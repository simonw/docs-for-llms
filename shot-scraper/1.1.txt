# Dumping out an accessibility tree

The `shot-scraper accessibility` command dumps out the Chromium accessibility tree for the provided URL, as JSON:

    shot-scraper accessibility https://datasette.io/

Use `-o filename.json` to write the output to a file instead of displaying it.

Add `--javascript SCRIPT` to execute custom JavaScript before taking the snapshot.

## `shot-scraper accessibility --help`

Full `--help` for this command:

<!-- [[[cog
import cog
from shot_scraper import cli
from click.testing import CliRunner
runner = CliRunner()
result = runner.invoke(cli.cli, ["accessibility", "--help"])
help = result.output.replace("Usage: cli", "Usage: shot-scraper")
cog.out(
    "```\n{}\n```\n".format(help.strip())
)

# Websites that need authentication

If you want to take screenshots of a site that has some form of authentication, you will first need to authenticate with that website manually.

You can do that using the `shot-scraper auth` command:

    shot-scraper auth https://datasette-auth-passwords-demo.datasette.io/-/login auth.json

(For this demo, use username = `root` and password = `password!`)

This will open a browser window on your computer showing the page you specified.

You can then sign in using that browser window - including 2FA or CAPTCHAs or other more complex form of authentication.

When you are finished, hit `<enter>` at the `shot-scraper` command-line prompt. The browser will close and the authentication credentials (usually cookies) for that browser session will be written out to the `auth.json` file.

To take authenticated screenshots you can then use the `-a` or `--auth` options to point to the JSON file that you created:

    shot-scraper https://datasette-auth-passwords-demo.datasette.io/ \
      -a auth.json -o authed.png

## `shot-scraper auth --help`

Full `--help` for `shot-scraper auth`:

<!-- [[[cog
import cog
from shot_scraper import cli
from click.testing import CliRunner
runner = CliRunner()
result = runner.invoke(cli.cli, ["auth", "--help"])
help = result.output.replace("Usage: cli", "Usage: shot-scraper")
cog.out(
    "```\n{}\n```\n".format(help.strip())
)
]]] -->
```
Usage: shot-scraper auth [OPTIONS] URL CONTEXT_FILE

  Open a browser so user can manually authenticate with the specified site, then
  save the resulting authentication context to a file.

  Usage:

      shot-scraper auth https://github.com/ auth.json

Options:
  -b, --browser [chromium|firefox|webkit|chrome|chrome-beta]
                                  Which browser to use
  --user-agent TEXT               User-Agent header to use
  --devtools                      Open browser DevTools
  --log-console                   Write console.log() to stderr
  --help                          Show this message and exit.

# Contributing

To contribute to this tool, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:

    cd shot-scraper
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Or if you are using `pipenv`:

    pipenv shell

Now install the dependencies and test dependencies:

    pip install -e '.[test]'

Then you'll need to install the Playwright browsers too:

    shot-scraper install

To run the tests:

    pytest

Some of the tests exercise the CLI utility directly. Run those like so:

    tests/run_examples.sh

## Documentation

Documentation for this project uses [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/) - it is written in Markdown and rendered using Sphinx.

To build the documentation locally, run the following:

    cd docs
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    make livehtml

This will start a live preview server, using [sphinx-autobuild](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autobuild/).

The CLI `--help` examples in the documentation are managed using [Cog](https://github.com/nedbat/cog). Update those files like this:

    cog -r docs/*.md

## Tweeting the release notes

After pushing a release, I use the following to create a screenshot of the release notes to use in a tweet:

    shot-scraper https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/releases/tag/0.15 \
      --selector '.Box-body' --width 700 \
      --retina

# Using shot-scraper with GitHub Actions

`shot-scraper` was designed with GitHub Actions for screenshot automation in mind.

## shot-scraper-template

The [shot-scraper-template](https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-template) template repository can be used to quickly create your own GitHub repository with GitHub Actions configured to take screenshots of a page and write it back to the repository. Read [Instantly create a GitHub repository to take screenshots of a web page](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/14/shot-scraper-template/) for details.

## Building a workflow from scratch

This Actions workflow can be used to install `shot-scraper` and its dependencies, take screenshots defined in the `shots.yml` file in that repository and then write the resulting screenshots back to the same repository:

```yaml
name: Take screenshots

on:
  push:
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  shot-scraper:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python 3.10
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: "3.10"
    - uses: actions/cache@v3
      name: Configure pip caching
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip
    - name: Cache Playwright browsers
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/ms-playwright/
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-playwright
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install shot-scraper
        shot-scraper install
    - name: Take shots
      run: |
        shot-scraper multi shots.yml
    - name: Commit and push
      run: |-
        git config user.name "Automated"
        git config user.email "actions@users.noreply.github.com"
        git add -A
        timestamp=$(date -u)
        git commit -m "${timestamp}" || exit 0
        git pull --rebase
        git push
```
The `actions/cache@v3` steps set up [caching](https://github.com/actions/cache), so your workflow will only download and install the necessary software the very first time it runs.

## Optimizing PNGs using Oxipng

You can losslessy compress the PNGs generated using `shot-scraper` by running them through [Oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng). Add the following steps to the beginning of your workflow to install Oxing:

```yaml
    - name: Cache Oxipng
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: ~/.cargo/
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-cargo
    - name: Install Oxipng if it is not installed
      run: |
        which oxipng || cargo install oxipng
```

Then after running `shot-scraper` add this step to compress the images:

```yaml
    - name: Optimize PNGs
      run: |-
        oxipng -o 4 -i 0 --strip safe *.png
```

[simonw/datasette-screenshots](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-screenshots) is an example of a repository that uses this pattern.

See [Optimizing PNGs in GitHub Actions using Oxipng](https://til.simonwillison.net/github-actions/oxipng) for more on how this works.

# Dumping the HTML of a page

The `shot-scraper html` command dumps out the final HTML of a page after all JavaScript has run.

    shot-scraper html https://datasette.io/

Use `-o filename.html` to write the output to a file instead of displaying it.

    shot-scraper html https://datasette.io/ -o index.html

Add `--javascript SCRIPT` to execute custom JavaScript before taking the HTML snapshot.

    shot-scraper html https://datasette.io/ \
      --javascript "document.querySelector('h1').innerText = 'Hello, world!'"

## Retrieving the HTML for a specific element

You can use the `-s SELECTOR` option to capture just the HTML for one specific element on the page, identified using a CSS selector:

    shot-scraper html https://datasette.io/ -s h1

This outputs:

    <h1>
      <img class="datasette-logo" src="/static/datasette-logo.svg" alt="Datasette">
    </h1>

## `shot-scraper html --help`

Full `--help` for this command:

<!-- [[[cog

cog.out(
    "```\n{}\n```\n".format(help.strip())
)
]]] -->
```
Usage: shot-scraper html [OPTIONS] URL

  Output the final HTML of the specified page

  Usage:

      shot-scraper html https://datasette.io/

# Installation

Install this tool using `pip`:

    pip install shot-scraper

This tool depends on Playwright, which first needs to install its own dedicated Chromium browser.

Run `shot-scraper install` once to install that:
```
% shot-scraper install
Downloading Playwright build of chromium v965416 - 117.2 Mb [====================] 100% 0.0s

Playwright build of ffmpeg v1007 downloaded to /Users/simon/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/ffmpeg-1007
```
If you want to use other browsers such as Firefox you should install those too:
```
% shot-scraper install -b firefox
```

## `shot-scraper install --help`

Full `--help` for the `shot-scraper install` command:
<!-- [[[cog
import cog
from shot_scraper import cli
from click.testing import CliRunner
runner = CliRunner()
result = runner.invoke(cli.cli, ["install", "--help"])
help = result.output.replace("Usage: cli", "Usage: shot-scraper")
cog.out(

# Scraping pages using JavaScript

The `shot-scraper javascript` command can be used to execute JavaScript directly against a page and return the result as JSON.

This command doesn't produce a screenshot, but has interesting applications for scraping.

To retrieve a string title of a document:

    shot-scraper javascript https://datasette.io/ "document.title"

This returns a JSON string:
```json
"Datasette: An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data"
```
To return a raw string instead, use the `-r` or `--raw` options:

    shot-scraper javascript https://datasette.io/ "document.title" -r

Output:

    Datasette: An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data

To return a JSON object, wrap an object literal in parenthesis:

    shot-scraper javascript https://datasette.io/ "({
      title: document.title,
      tagline: document.querySelector('.tagline').innerText
    })"

This returns:
```json
{
  "title": "Datasette: An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data",
  "tagline": "An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data"
}
```
## Running more than one statement

You can use `() => { ... }` function syntax to run multiple statements, returning a result at the end of your function.

This example raises an error if no paragraphs are found.

```bash
shot-scraper javascript https://www.example.com/ "
() => {
  var paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll('p');
  if (paragraphs.length == 0) {
    throw 'No paragraphs found';
  }
  return Array.from(paragraphs, el => el.innerText);
}"
```

## Using async/await

You can pass an `async` function if you want to use `await`, including to import modules from external URLs. This example loads the [Readability.js](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) library from [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/) and uses it to extract the core content of a page:

```
shot-scraper javascript \
  https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/14/scraping-web-pages-shot-scraper/ "
async () => {
  const readability = await import('https://cdn.skypack.dev/@mozilla/readability');
  return (new readability.Readability(document)).parse();
}"
```

To use functions such as `setInterval()`, for example if you need to delay the shot for a second to allow an animation to finish running, return a promise:

    shot-scraper javascript datasette.io "
    new Promise(done => setInterval(
      () => {
        done({
          title: document.title,
          tagline: document.querySelector('.tagline').innerText
        });
      }, 1000
    ));"

## Running JavaScript from a file

You can also save JavaScript to a file and execute it like this:

    shot-scraper javascript datasette.io -i script.js

Or read it from standard input like this:

    echo "document.title" | shot-scraper javascript datasette.io

## Using this for automated tests

If a JavaScript error occurs, a stack trace will be written to standard error and the tool will terminate with an exit code of 1.

This can be used to run JavaScript tests in continuous integration environments, by taking advantage of the `throw "error message"` JavaScript statement.

This example [uses GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart):

```yaml
- name: Test page title
  run: |-
    shot-scraper javascript datasette.io "
      if (document.title != 'Datasette') {
        throw 'Wrong title detected';
      }"
```

## Example: Extracting page content with Readability.js

[Readability.js](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) is "a standalone version of the readability library used for Firefox Reader View." It lets you parse the content on a web page and extract just the title, content, byline and some other key metadata.

The following recipe imports the library from the [Skypack CDN](https://www.skypack.dev/), runs it against the current page and returns the results to the console as JSON:

```bash
shot-scraper javascript https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/24/datasette-061/ "
async () => {
  const readability = await import('https://cdn.skypack.dev/@mozilla/readability');
  return (new readability.Readability(document)).parse();
}"
```
The output looks like this:
```json
{
    "title": "Datasette 0.61: The annotated release notes",
    "byline": null,
    "dir": null,
    "lang": "en-gb",
    "content": "<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div id=\"primary\">\n\n\n\n\n<p>I released ... <this is a very long string>",
    "length": 8625,
    "excerpt": "I released Datasette 0.61 this morning\u2014closely followed by 0.61.1 to fix a minor bug. Here are the annotated release notes. In preparation for Datasette 1.0, this release includes two potentially \u2026",
    "siteName": null
}
```

# Taking multiple screenshots

You can configure multiple screenshots using a YAML file. Create a file called `shots.yml` that looks like this:

```yaml
- output: example.com.png
  url: http://www.example.com/
- output: w3c.org.png
  url: https://www.w3.org/
```
Then run the tool like so:

    shot-scraper multi shots.yml

This will create two image files, `www-example-com.png` and `w3c.org.png`, containing screenshots of those two URLs.

Use `-` to pass in YAML from standard input:

    echo "- url: http://www.example.com" | shot-scraper multi -

If you run the tool with the `-n` or `--no-clobber` option any shots where the output file aleady exists will be skipped.

You can specify a subset of screenshots to take by specifying output files that you would like to create. For example, to take just the shots of `one.png` and `three.png` that are defined in `shots.yml` run this:

    shot-scraper multi shots.yml -o one.png -o three.png

The `url:` can be set to a path to a file on disk as well:

```yaml
- output: index.png
  url: index.html
```

Use `--retina` to take all screenshots at retina resolution instead, doubling the dimensions of the files:

    shot-scraper multi shots.yml --retina

Use `--fail-on-error` to fail noisily on error (may be helpful in CI):

    shot-scraper multi shots.yml --fail-on-error

To take a screenshot of just the area of a page defined by a CSS selector, add `selector` to the YAML block:

```yaml
- output: bighead.png
  url: https://simonwillison.net/
  selector: "#bighead"
```

You can pass more than one selector using a `selectors:` list. You can also use `padding:` to specify additional padding:

```yaml
- output: bighead-multi-selector.png
  url: https://simonwillison.net/
  selectors:
  - "#bighead"
  - .overband
  padding: 20
```

You can use `selector_all:` to capture every element matching a selector, or `selectors_all:` to pass a list of such selectors:

```yaml
- output: selectors-all.png
  url: https://simonwillison.net/
  selectors_all:
  - .day
  - .entry:nth-of-type(1)
  padding: 20
```

The `--js-selector` and `--js-selector-all` options can be provided using the `js_selector:`, `js_selectors:`, `js_selector_all:` and `js_selectors_all:` keys:

```yaml
- output: js-selector-all.png
  url: https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper
  js_selector: |-
    el.tagName == "P" && el.innerText.includes("shot-scraper")
  padding: 20
```

To execute JavaScript after the page has loaded but before the screenshot is taken, add a `javascript` key:

```yaml
- output: bighead-pink.png
  url: https://simonwillison.net/
  selector: "#bighead"
  javascript: |
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'pink'
```

You can include desired `height`, `width`, `quality`, `wait` and `wait_for` options on each item as well:

```yaml
- output: simon-narrow.jpg
  url: https://simonwillison.net/
  width: 400
  height: 800
  quality: 80
  wait: 500
  wait_for: document.querySelector('#bighead')
```

# Saving a web page to PDF

The `shot-scraper pdf` command saves a PDF version of a web page - the equivalent of using `Print -> Save to PDF` in Chromium.

    shot-scraper pdf https://datasette.io/

This will save to `datasette-io.pdf`. You can use `-o` to specify a filename:

    shot-scraper pdf https://datasette.io/tutorials/learn-sql \
      -o learn-sql.pdf

You can pass the path to a local file on disk instead of a URL:

    shot-scraper pdf invoice.html -o invoice.pdf

# Taking a screenshot

To take a screenshot of a web page and write it to `datasette-io.png` run this:

    shot-scraper https://datasette.io/

If a file called `datasette-io.png` already exists the filename `datasette-io.1.png` will be used instead.

You can use the `-o` option to specify a filename:

    shot-scraper https://datasette.io/ -o datasette.png

Use `-o -` to write the PNG image to standard output:

    shot-scraper https://datasette.io/ -o - > datasette.png

If you omit the protocol `http://` will be added automatically, and any redirects will be followed:

    shot-scraper datasette.io -o datasette.png

## Adjusting the browser width and height

The browser window used to take the screenshots defaults to 1280px wide and 780px tall.

You can adjust these with the `--width` and `--height` options (`-w` and `-h` for short):

    shot-scraper https://datasette.io/ -o small.png --width 400 --height 800

If you provide both options, the resulting screenshot will be of that size. If you omit `--height` a full page length screenshot will be produced (the default).

## Screenshotting a specific area with CSS selectors

To take a screenshot of a specific element on the page, use `--selector` or `-s` with its CSS selector:

    shot-scraper https://simonwillison.net/ -s '#bighead'

This produces `simonwillison-net.png` containing this image:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/shot-scraper-screenshot/main/shot-selector.png" alt="Just the header section from my blog">

When using `--selector` the height and width, if provided, will set the size of the browser window when the page is loaded but the resulting screenshot will still be the same dimensions as the element on the page.

You can pass `--selector` multiple times. The resulting screenshot will cover the smallest area of the page that contains all of the elements you specified, for example:

    shot-scraper https://simonwillison.net/ \
      -s '#bighead' -s .overband \
      -o bighead-multi-selector.png

To capture a rectangle around every element that matches a CSS selector, use `--selector-all`:

    shot-scraper https://simonwillison.net/ \
      --selector-all '.day' \
      -o just-the-day-boxes.png

You can add `--padding 20` to add 20px of padding around the elements when the shot is taken.

## Specifying elements using JavaScript filters

The `--js-selector` and `--js-selector-all` options can be used to use JavaScript expressions to select elements that cannot be targetted just using CSS selectors.

The options should be passed JavaScript expression that operates on the `el` variable, returning `true` if that element should be included in the screenshot selection.

To take a screenshot of the first paragraph on the page that contains the text "shot-scraper" you could run the following:

    shot-scraper https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper \
      --js-selector 'el.tagName == "P" && el.innerText.includes("shot-scraper")'

The `el.tagName == "P"` part is needed here because otherwise the `<html>` element on the page will be the first to match the expression.

The generated JavaScript that will be executed on the page looks like this:
```javascript
Array.from(document.getElementsByTagName('*')).find(
  el => el.tagName == "P" && el.innerText.includes("shot-scraper")
).classList.add("js-selector-a1f5ba0fc4a4317e58a3bd11a0f16b96");
```
The `--js-selector-all` option will select all matching elements, in a similar fashion to the `--selector-all` option described above.

## Waiting for a delay

Sometimes a page will not have completely loaded before a screenshot is taken. You can use `--wait X` to wait the specified number of milliseconds after the page load event has fired before taking the screenshot:

    shot-scraper https://simonwillison.net/ --wait 2000

## Waiting until a specific condition

In addition to waiting a specific amount of time, you can also wait until a JavaScript expression returns true using the `--wait-for expression` option.

This example takes the screenshot the moment a `<div>` with an ID of `content` becomes available in the DOM:

    shot-scraper https://.../ \
      --wait-for 'document.querySelector("div#content")'

## Executing custom JavaScript

You can use custom JavaScript to modify the page after it has loaded (after the 'onload' event has fired) but before the screenshot is taken using the `--javascript` option:

    shot-scraper https://simonwillison.net/ \
      -o simonwillison-pink.png \
      --javascript "document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'pink';"

## Using JPEGs instead of PNGs

Screenshots default to PNG. You can save as a JPEG by specifying a `-o` filename that ends with `.jpg`.

You can also use `--quality X` to save as a JPEG with the specified quality, in order to reduce the filesize. 80 is a good value to use here:

    shot-scraper https://simonwillison.net/ \
      -h 800 -o simonwillison.jpg --quality 80
    % ls -lah simonwillison.jpg
    -rw-r--r--@ 1 simon  staff   168K Mar  9 13:53 simonwillison.jpg

## Retina images

The `--retina` option sets a device scale factor of 2. This means that an image will have its resolution effectively doubled, emulating the display of images on [retina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_display) or higher pixel density screens.

    shot-scraper https://simonwillison.net/ -o simon.png \
      --width 400 --height 600 --retina

This example will produce an image that is 800px wide and 1200px high.

## Interacting with the page

Sometimes it's useful to be able to manually interact with a page before the screenshot is captured.

Add the `--interactive` option to open a browser window that you can interact with. Then hit `<enter>` in the terminal when you are ready to take the shot and close the window.

    shot-scraper https://simonwillison.net/ -o after-interaction.png \
      --height 800 --interactive

This will output:

    Hit <enter> to take the shot and close the browser window:
      # And after you hit <enter>...
    Screenshot of 'https://simonwillison.net/' written to 'after-interaction.png'

## Logging all requests

It can sometimes be useful to see a list of all of the requests that the browser made while it was rendering a page.

Use `--log-requests` to output newline-delimited JSON representing each request, including requests for images and other assets.

Pass `-` to output the list to standard output, or use a filename to write to a file on disk.

The output looks like this:
```
% shot-scraper http://datasette.io/ --log-requests -
{"method": "GET", "url": "http://datasette.io/", "status": 302, "size": null, "timing": {"startTime": 1663211674984.7068, "domainLookupStart": 0.698, "domainLookupEnd": 1.897, "connectStart": 1.897, "secureConnectionStart": -1, "connectEnd": 18.726, "requestStart": 18.86, "responseStart": 99.75, "responseEnd": 101.75000000162981}}
{"method": "GET", "url": "https://datasette.io/", "status": 200, "size": 34592, "timing": {"startTime": 1663211675085.51, "domainLookupStart": 0.187, "domainLookupEnd": 0.197, "connectStart": 0.197, "secureConnectionStart": 15.719, "connectEnd": 63.854, "requestStart": 64.098, "responseStart": 390.231, "responseEnd": 399.268}}
{"method": "GET", "url": "https://datasette.io/static/site.css", "status": 200, "size": 3952, "timing": {"startTime": 1663211675486.027, "domainLookupStart": -1, "domainLookupEnd": -1, "connectStart": -1, "secureConnectionStart": -1, "connectEnd": -1, "requestStart": 0.408, "responseStart": 99.407, "responseEnd": 100.433}}
...
```
Note that the `size` field here will be the size of the response in bytes, but in some circumstances this will not be available and it will be returned as `"size": null`.

## Taking screenshots of local HTML files

You can pass the path to an HTML file on disk to take a screenshot of that rendered file:

    shot-scraper index.html -o index.png

CSS and images referenced from that file using relative paths will also be included.

## Tips for executing JavaScript

If you are using the `--javascript` option to execute code, that code will be executed after the page load event has fired but before the screenshot is taken.

You can use that code to do things like hide or remove specific page elements, click on links to open menus, or even add annotations to the page such as this [pink arrow example](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/10/shot-scraper/#a-complex-example).

This code hides any element with a `[data-ad-rendered]` attribute and the element with `id="ensNotifyBanner"`:

    document.querySelectorAll(
        '[data-ad-rendered],#ensNotifyBanner'
    ).forEach(el => el.style.display = 'none')

You can execute that like so:

```
shot-scraper https://www.latimes.com/ -o latimes.png --javascript "
document.querySelectorAll(
    '[data-ad-rendered],#ensNotifyBanner'
).forEach(el => el.style.display = 'none')
"
```

In some cases you may need to add a pause that executes during your custom JavaScript before the screenshot is taken - for example if you click on a button that triggers a short fading animation.

You can do that using the following pattern:
```javascript
new Promise(takeShot => {
  // Your code goes here
  // ...
  setTimeout(() => {
    // Resolving the promise takes the shot
    takeShot();
  }, 1000);
});
```
If your custom code defines a `Promise`, `shot-scraper` will wait for that promise to complete before taking the screenshot. Here the screenshot does not occur until the `takeShot()` function is called.

## Viewing console.log() output

Almost all of the `shot-scraper` commands accept a `--log-console` option, which will cause them to output any calls to `console.log()` to standard error while the command is running.

This includes both `console.log()` calls in the existing page JavaScript, as well as any calls to that method that you include in your own custom JavaScript.

For example, running `--log-console` while taking a screenshot of the Facebook homepage will show this warning message, which Facebook logs to the developer tools console to help protect people from social engineering attacks:

```
% shot-scraper shot facebook.com --log-console

 .d8888b.  888                       888
d88P  Y88b 888                       888
Y88b.      888                       888    This is a browser feature intended for
 "Y888b.   888888  .d88b.  88888b.   888    developers. If someone told you to copy-paste
    "Y88b. 888    d88""88b 888 "88b  888    something here to enable a Facebook feature
      "888 888    888  888 888  888  Y8P    or "hack" someone's account, it is a
Y88b  d88P Y88b.  Y88..88P 888 d88P         scam and will give them access to your
 "Y8888P"   "Y888  "Y88P"  88888P"   888    Facebook account.
                           888
                           888
                           888
