# Model aliases

LLM supports model aliases, which allow you to refer to a model by a short name instead of its full ID.

## Listing aliases

To list current aliases, run this:

```bash
llm aliases
```
Example output:

<!-- [[[cog
from click.testing import CliRunner
from llm.cli import cli
result = CliRunner().invoke(cli, ["aliases", "list"])
cog.out("```\n{}```".format(result.output))
]]] -->
```
3.5         : gpt-3.5-turbo
chatgpt     : gpt-3.5-turbo
chatgpt-16k : gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
3.5-16k     : gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
4           : gpt-4
gpt4        : gpt-4
4-32k       : gpt-4-32k
```
<!-- [[[end]]] -->

Add `--json` to get that list back as JSON:

```bash
llm aliases list --json
```
Example output:
```json
{
    "3.5": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "chatgpt": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "chatgpt-16k": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k",
    "3.5-16k": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k",
    "4": "gpt-4",
    "gpt4": "gpt-4",
    "4-32k": "gpt-4-32k"
}
```

## Adding a new alias

The `llm aliases set <alias> <model-id>` command can be used to add a new alias:

```bash
llm aliases set turbo gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
```
Now you can run the `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` model using the `turbo` alias like this:

```bash
llm -m turbo 'An epic Greek-style saga about a cheesecake that builds a SQL database from scratch'
```

## Removing an alias

The `llm aliases remove <alias>` command will remove the specified alias:

```bash
llm aliases remove turbo
```

## Viewing the aliases file

Aliases are stored in an `aliases.json` file in the LLM configuration directory.

To see the path to that file, run this:

```bash
llm aliases path
```
To view the content of that file, run this:

```bash
cat "$(llm aliases path)"
```

# Changelog

(v0_7_1)=
## 0.7.1 (2023-08-19)

- Fixed a bug where some users would see an `AlterError: No such column: log.id` error when attempting to use this tool, after upgrading to the latest [sqlite-utils 3.35 release](https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-35). [#162](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/162)

(v0_7)=
## 0.7 (2023-08-12)

The new {ref}`aliases` commands can be used to configure additional aliases for models, for example:

```bash
llm aliases set turbo gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
```
Now you can run the 16,000 token `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` model like this:

```bash
llm -m turbo 'An epic Greek-style saga about a cheesecake that builds a SQL database from scratch'
```
Use `llm aliases list` to see a list of aliases and `llm aliases remove turbo` to remove one again. [#151](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/151)

### Notable new plugins

- **[llm-mlc](https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlc)** can run local models released by the [MLC project](https://mlc.ai/mlc-llm/), including models that can take advantage of the GPU on Apple Silicon M1/M2 devices.
- **[llm-llama-cpp](https://github.com/simonw/llm-llama-cpp)** uses [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) to run models published in the GGML format. See [Run Llama 2 on your own Mac using LLM and Homebrew](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/1/llama-2-mac/) for more details.

- `llm install --no-cache-dir` and `--force-reinstall` options. [#146](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/146)

(v0_6_1)=
## 0.6.1 (2023-07-24)

- LLM can now be installed directly from Homebrew core: `brew install llm`. [#124](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/124)
- Python API documentation now covers {ref}`python-api-system-prompts`.
- Fixed incorrect example in the {ref}`prompt-templates` documentation. Thanks, Jorge Cabello. [#125](https://github.com/simonw/llm/pull/125)

(v0_6)=
## 0.6 (2023-07-18)

- Models hosted on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) can now be accessed using the [llm-replicate](https://github.com/simonw/llm-replicate) plugin, including the new Llama 2 model from Meta AI. More details here: [Accessing Llama 2 from the command-line with the llm-replicate plugin](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/18/accessing-llama-2/).
- Model providers that expose an API that is compatible with the OpenAPI API format, including self-hosted model servers such as [LocalAI](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI), can now be accessed using {ref}`additional configuration <openai-compatible-models>` for the default OpenAI plugin. [#106](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/106)
- OpenAI models that are not yet supported by LLM can also {ref}`be configured <openai-extra-models>` using the new `extra-openai-models.yaml` configuration file. [#107](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/107)
- The {ref}`llm logs command <viewing-logs>` now accepts a `-m model_id` option to filter logs to a specific model. Aliases can be used here in addition to model IDs. [#108](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/108)
- Logs now have a SQLite full-text search index against their prompts and responses, and the `llm logs -q SEARCH` option can be used to return logs that match a search term. [#109](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/109)

(v0_5)=
## 0.5 (2023-07-12)

LLM now supports **additional language models**, thanks to a new {ref}`plugins mechanism <installing-plugins>` for installing additional models.

Plugins are available for 19 models in addition to the default OpenAI ones:

- [llm-gpt4all](https://github.com/simonw/llm-gpt4all) adds support for 17 models that can download and run on your own device, including Vicuna, Falcon and wizardLM.
- [llm-mpt30b](https://github.com/simonw/llm-mpt30b) adds support for the MPT-30B model, a 19GB download.
- [llm-palm](https://github.com/simonw/llm-palm) adds support for Google's PaLM 2 via the Google API.

A comprehensive tutorial, {ref}`writing a plugin to support a new model <tutorial-model-plugin>` describes how to add new models by building plugins in detail.

### New features

- {ref}`python-api` documentation for using LLM models, including models from plugins, directly from Python. [#75](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/75)
- Messages are now logged to the database by default - no need to run the `llm init-db` command any more, which has been removed. Instead, you can toggle this behavior off using `llm logs off` or turn it on again using `llm logs on`. The `llm logs status` command shows the current status of the log database. If logging is turned off, passing `--log` to the `llm prompt` command will cause that prompt to be logged anyway. [#98](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/98)
- New database schema for logged messages, with `conversations` and `responses` tables. If you have previously used the old `logs` table it will continue to exist but will no longer be written to. [#91](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/91)
- New `-o/--option name value` syntax for setting options for models, such as temperature. Available options differ for different models. [#63](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/63)
- `llm models list --options` command for viewing all available model options. [#82](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/82)
- `llm "prompt" --save template` option for saving a prompt directly to a template. [#55](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/55)
- Prompt templates can now specify {ref}`default values <prompt-default-parameters>` for parameters. Thanks,  Chris Mungall. [#57](https://github.com/simonw/llm/pull/57)
- `llm openai models` command to list all available OpenAI models from their API. [#70](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/70)
- `llm models default MODEL_ID` to set a different model as the default to be used when `llm` is run without the `-m/--model` option. [#31](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/31)

### Smaller improvements

- `llm -s` is now a shortcut for `llm --system`. [#69](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/69)
- `llm -m 4-32k` alias for `gpt-4-32k`.
- `llm install -e directory` command for installing a plugin from a local directory.
- The `LLM_USER_PATH` environment variable now controls the location of the directory in which LLM stores its data. This replaces the old `LLM_KEYS_PATH` and `LLM_LOG_PATH` and `LLM_TEMPLATES_PATH` variables. [#76](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/76)
- Documentation covering {ref}`plugin-utilities`.
- Documentation site now uses Plausible for analytics. [#79](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/79)

(v0_4_1)=
## 0.4.1 (2023-06-17)

- LLM can now be installed using Homebrew: `brew install simonw/llm/llm`. [#50](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/50)
- `llm` is now styled LLM in the documentation. [#45](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/45)
- Examples in documentation now include a copy button. [#43](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/43)
- `llm templates` command no longer has its display disrupted by newlines. [#42](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/42)
- `llm templates` command now includes system prompt, if set. [#44](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/44)

(v0_4)=
## 0.4 (2023-06-17)

This release includes some backwards-incompatible changes:

- The `-4` option for GPT-4 is now `-m 4`.
- The `--code` option has been removed.
- The `-s` option has been removed as streaming is now the default. Use `--no-stream` to opt out of streaming.

### Prompt templates

{ref}`prompt-templates` is a new feature that allows prompts to be saved as templates and re-used with different variables.

Templates can be created using the `llm templates edit` command:

```bash
llm templates edit summarize
```
Templates are YAML - the following template defines summarization using a system prompt:

```yaml
system: Summarize this text
```
The template can then be executed like this:
```bash
cat myfile.txt | llm -t summarize
```
Templates can include both system prompts, regular prompts and indicate the model they should use. They can reference variables such as `$input` for content piped to the tool, or other variables that are passed using the new `-p/--param` option.

This example adds a `voice` parameter:

```yaml
system: Summarize this text in the voice of $voice
```
Then to run it (via [strip-tags](https://github.com/simonw/strip-tags) to remove HTML tags from the input):
```bash
curl -s 'https://til.simonwillison.net/macos/imovie-slides-and-audio' | \
  strip-tags -m | llm -t summarize -p voice GlaDOS
```
Example output:

> My previous test subject seemed to have learned something new about iMovie. They exported keynote slides as individual images [...] Quite impressive for a human.

The {ref}`prompt-templates` documentation provides more detailed examples.

### Continue previous chat

You can now use `llm` to continue a previous conversation with the OpenAI chat models (`gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4`). This will include your previous prompts and responses in the prompt sent to the API, allowing the model to continue within the same context.

Use the new `-c/--continue` option to continue from the previous message thread:

```bash
llm "Pretend to be a witty gerbil, say hi briefly"
```
> Greetings, dear human! I am a clever gerbil, ready to entertain you with my quick wit and endless energy.
```bash
llm "What do you think of snacks?" -c
```
> Oh, how I adore snacks, dear human! Crunchy carrot sticks, sweet apple slices, and chewy yogurt drops are some of my favorite treats. I could nibble on them all day long!

The `-c` option will continue from the most recent logged message.

To continue a different chat, pass an integer ID to the `--chat` option. This should be the ID of a previously logged message. You can find these IDs using the `llm logs` command.

Thanks [Amjith Ramanujam](https://github.com/amjith) for contributing to this feature. [#6](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/6)

### New mechanism for storing API keys

API keys for language models such as those by OpenAI can now be saved using the new `llm keys` family of commands.

To set the default key to be used for the OpenAI APIs, run this:

```bash
llm keys set openai
```
Then paste in your API key.

Keys can also be passed using the new `--key` command line option - this can be a full key or the alias of a key that has been previously stored.

See link-to-docs for more. [#13](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/13)

### New location for the logs.db database

The `logs.db` database that stores a history of executed prompts no longer lives at `~/.llm/log.db` - it can now be found in a location that better fits the host operating system, which can be seen using:

```bash
llm logs path
```
On macOS this is `~/Library/Application Support/io.datasette.llm/logs.db`.

To open that database using Datasette, run this:

```bash
datasette "$(llm logs path)"
```
You can upgrade your existing installation by copying your database to the new location like this:
```bash
cp ~/.llm/log.db "$(llm logs path)"
rm -rf ~/.llm # To tidy up the now obsolete directory
```
The database schema has changed, and will be updated automatically the first time you run the command.

That schema is [included in the documentation](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/logging.html#sql-schema). [#35](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/35)

### Other changes

- New `llm logs --truncate` option (shortcut `-t`) which truncates the displayed prompts to make the log output easier to read. [#16](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/16)
- Documentation now spans multiple pages and lives at <https://llm.datasette.io/> [#21](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/21)
- Default `llm chatgpt` command has been renamed to `llm prompt`. [#17](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/17)
- Removed `--code` option in favour of new prompt templates mechanism. [#24](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/24)
- Responses are now streamed by default, if the model supports streaming. The `-s/--stream` option has been removed. A new `--no-stream` option can be used to opt-out of streaming.  [#25](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/25)
- The `-4/--gpt4` option has been removed in favour of `-m 4` or `-m gpt4`, using a new mechanism that allows models to have additional short names.
- The new `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` model with a 16,000 token context length can now also be accessed using `-m chatgpt-16k` or `-m 3.5-16k`. Thanks, Benjamin Kirkbride. [#37](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/37)
- Improved display of error messages from OpenAI. [#15](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/15)

(v0_3)=
## 0.3 (2023-05-17)

- `llm logs` command for browsing logs of previously executed completions. [#3](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/3)
- `llm "Python code to output factorial 10" --code` option which sets a system prompt designed to encourage code to be output without any additional explanatory text. [#5](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/5)
- Tool can now accept a prompt piped directly to standard input. [#11](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/11)

(v0_2)=
## 0.2 (2023-04-01)

- If a SQLite database exists in `~/.llm/log.db` all prompts and responses are logged to that file. The `llm init-db` command can be used to create this file. [#2](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/2)

(v0_1)=
## 0.1 (2023-04-01)

A CLI utility and Python library for interacting with Large Language Models, including OpenAI, PaLM and local models installed on your own machine.

Background on this project:
- [llm, ttok and strip-tags‚ÄîCLI tools for working with ChatGPT and other LLMs](https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/18/cli-tools-for-llms/)
- [The LLM CLI tool now supports self-hosted language models via plugins](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/12/llm/)
- [Accessing Llama 2 from the command-line with the llm-replicate plugin](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/18/accessing-llama-2/)

- [Catching up on the weird world of LLMs](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/3/weird-world-of-llms/)

## Quick start

First, install LLM using `pip` or Homebrew:

```bash
pip install llm
```
Or with Homebrew:
```bash
brew install llm
```
If you have an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) key you can run this:
```bash
# Paste your OpenAI API key into this
llm keys set openai

# Run a prompt
llm "Ten fun names for a pet pelican"

# Run a system prompt against a file
cat myfile.py | llm -s "Explain this code"
```
Or you can {ref}`install a plugin <installing-plugins>` and use models that can run on your local device:
```bash
# Install the plugin
llm install llm-gpt4all

# Download and run a prompt against the Vicuna model
llm -m ggml-vicuna-7b-1 'What is the capital of France?'
```

# Logging to SQLite

`llm` defaults to logging all prompts and responses to a SQLite database.

You can find the location of that database using the `llm logs path` command:

```bash
llm logs path
```
On my Mac that outputs:
```
/Users/simon/Library/Application Support/io.datasette.llm/logs.db
```
This will differ for other operating systems.

To avoid logging an individual prompt, pass `--no-log` or `-n` to the command:
```bash
llm 'Ten names for cheesecakes' -n
```

To turn logging by default off:

```bash
llm logs off
```
If you've turned off logging you can still log an individual prompt and response by adding `--log`:
```bash
llm 'Five ambitious names for a pet pterodactyl' --log
```
To turn logging by default back on again:

```bash
llm logs on
```
To see the status of the logs database, run this:
```bash
llm logs status
```
Example output:
```
Logging is ON for all prompts
Found log database at /Users/simon/Library/Application Support/io.datasette.llm/logs.db
Number of conversations logged: 33
Number of responses logged:     48
Database file size:             19.96MB
```

(viewing-logs)=

## Viewing the logs

You can view the logs using the `llm logs` command:
```bash
llm logs
```
This will output the three most recent logged items as a JSON array of objects.

Add `-n 10` to see the ten most recent items:
```bash
llm logs -n 10
```
Or `-n 0` to see everything that has ever been logged:
```bash
llm logs -n 0
```
You can search the logs for a search term in the `prompt` or the `response` columns:
```bash
llm logs -q 'cheesecake'
```
You can filter to logs just for a specific model (or model alias) using `-m/--model`:
```bash
llm logs -m chatgpt
```
You can truncate the display of the prompts and responses using the `-t/--truncate` option:
```bash
llm logs -n 5 -t
```
This is useful for finding a conversation that you would like to continue.

You can also use [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) to browse your logs like this:

```bash
datasette "$(llm logs path)"
```
## SQL schema

Here's the SQL schema used by the `logs.db` database:

<!-- [[[cog
import cog
from llm.migrations import migrate
import sqlite_utils
import re
db = sqlite_utils.Database(memory=True)
migrate(db)

def cleanup_sql(sql):
    first_line = sql.split('(')[0]
    inner = re.search(r'\((.*)\)', sql, re.DOTALL).group(1)
    columns = [l.strip() for l in inner.split(',')]
    return first_line + '(\n  ' + ',\n  '.join(columns) + '\n);'

cog.out("```sql\n")
for table in ("conversations", "responses", "responses_fts"):
    schema = db[table].schema
    cog.out(format(cleanup_sql(schema)))
    cog.out("\n")
cog.out("```\n")
]]] -->
```sql
CREATE TABLE [conversations] (
  [id] TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  [name] TEXT,
  [model] TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE [responses] (
  [id] TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  [model] TEXT,
  [prompt] TEXT,
  [system] TEXT,
  [prompt_json] TEXT,
  [options_json] TEXT,
  [response] TEXT,
  [response_json] TEXT,
  [conversation_id] TEXT REFERENCES [conversations]([id]),
  [duration_ms] INTEGER,
  [datetime_utc] TEXT
);
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE [responses_fts] USING FTS5 (
  [prompt],
  [response],
  content=[responses]
);
```
<!-- [[[end]]] -->
`responses_fts` configures [SQLite full-text search](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html) against the `prompt` and `response` columns in the `responses` table.

# Other models

LLM supports OpenAI models by default. You can install {ref}`plugins` to add support for other models. You can also add additional OpenAI-compatible models {ref}`using a configuration file <openai-extra-models>`.

## Installing and using a local model

{ref}`LLM plugins <plugins>` can provide local models that run on your machine.

To install **[llm-gpt4all](https://github.com/simonw/llm-gpt4all)**, providing 17 models from the [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/) project, run this:

```bash
llm install llm-gpt4all
```
Run `llm models list` to see the expanded list of available models.

To run a prompt through one of the models from GPT4All specify it using `-m/--model`:
```bash
llm -m ggml-vicuna-7b-1 'What is the capital of France?'
```
The model will be downloaded and cached the first time you use it.

Check the **[llm-plugins](https://github.com/simonw/llm-plugins)** repository for the latest list of available plugins for other models.

(openai-extra-models)=

## Adding more OpenAI models

OpenAI occasionally release new models with new names. LLM aims to ship new releases to support these, but you can also configure them directly, by adding them to a `extra-openai-models.yaml` configuration file.

Run this command to find the directory in which this file should be created:

```bash
dirname "$(llm logs path)"
```
On my Mac laptop I get this:
```
~/Library/Application Support/io.datasette.llm
```
Create a file in that directory called `extra-openai-models.yaml`.

Let's say OpenAI have just released the `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` model and you want to use it, despite LLM not yet shipping support. You could configure that by adding this to the file:

```yaml
- model_id: gpt-3.5-turbo-0613
  aliases: ["0613"]
```
The `model_id` is the identifier that will be recorded in the LLM logs. You can use this to specify the model, or you can optionally include a list of aliases for that model.

With this configuration in place, the following command should run a prompt against the new model:

```bash
llm -m 0613 'What is the capital of France?'
```
Run `llm models list` to confirm that the new model is now available:
```bash
llm models list
```
Example output:
```
OpenAI Chat: gpt-3.5-turbo (aliases: 3.5, chatgpt)
OpenAI Chat: gpt-3.5-turbo-16k (aliases: chatgpt-16k, 3.5-16k)
OpenAI Chat: gpt-4 (aliases: 4, gpt4)
OpenAI Chat: gpt-4-32k (aliases: 4-32k)
OpenAI Chat: gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 (aliases: 0613)
```
Running `llm logs -n 1` should confirm that the prompt and response has been correctly logged to the database.

(openai-compatible-models)=

## OpenAI-compatible models

Projects such as [LocalAI](https://localai.io/) offer a REST API that imitates the OpenAI API but can be used to run other models, including models that can be installed on your own machine. These can be added using the same configuration mechanism.

The `model_id` is the name LLM will use for the model. The `model_name` is the name which needs to be passed to the API - this might differ from the `model_id`, especially if the `model_id` could potentially clash with other installed models.

The `api_base` key can be used to point the OpenAI client library at a different API endpoint.

To add the `orca-mini-3b` model hosted by a local installation of [LocalAI](https://localai.io/), add this to your `extra-openai-models.yaml` file:

```yaml
- model_id: orca-openai-compat
  model_name: orca-mini-3b.ggmlv3
  api_base: "http://localhost:8080"
```
If the `api_base` is set, the existing configured `openai` API key will not be sent by default.

You can set `api_key_name` to the name of a key stored using the {ref}`api-keys` feature.

Having configured the model like this, run `llm models list` to check that it installed correctly. You can then run prompts against it like so:

```bash
llm -m orca-openai-compat 'What is the capital of France?'
```
And confirm they were logged correctly with:
```bash
llm logs -n 1
```

(python-api)=
# Python API

LLM provides a Python API for executing prompts, in addition to the command-line interface.

Understanding this API is also important for writing {ref}`plugins`.

## Basic prompt execution

To run a prompt against the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model, run this:

```python
import llm

model = llm.get_model("gpt-3.5-turbo")
model.key = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
response = model.prompt("Five surprising names for a pet pelican")
print(response.text())
```
The `llm.get_model()` function accepts model names or aliases - so `chatgpt` would work here too.

Run this command to see a list of available models and their aliases:

```bash
llm models list
```
If you have set a `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable you can omit the `model.key = ` line.

(python-api-system-prompts)=

### System prompts

For models that accept a system prompt, pass it as `system="..."`:

```python
response = model.prompt(
    "Five surprising names for a pet pelican",
    system="Answer like GlaDOS"
)
```

### Models from plugins

Any models you have installed as plugins will also be available through this mechanism, for example to use Google's PaLM 2 model with [llm-palm](https://github.com/simonw/llm-palm)

```bash
pip install llm-palm
```
```python
import llm

model = llm.get_model("palm")
model.key = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
response = model.prompt("Five surprising names for a pet pelican")
print(response.text())
```
You can omit the `model.key = ` line for models that do not use an API key

## Streaming responses

For models that support it you can stream responses as they are generated, like this:

```python
response = model.prompt("Five diabolical names for a pet goat")
for chunk in response:
    print(chunk, end="")
```
The `response.text()` method described earlier does this for you - it runs through the iterator and gathers the results into a string.

If a response has been evaluated, `response.text()` will continue to return the same string.

## Conversations

LLM supports *conversations*, where you ask follow-up questions of a model as part of an ongoing conversation.

To start a new conversation, use the `model.conversation()` method:

```python
model = llm.get_model("gpt-3.5-turbo")
model.key = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
conversation = model.conversation()
```
You can then use the `conversation.prompt()` method to execute prompts against this conversation:

```python
response = conversation.prompt("Five fun facts about pelicans")
print(response.text())
```
This works exactly the same as the `model.prompt()` method, except that the conversation will be maintained across multiple prompts. So if you run this next:
```python
response2 = conversation.prompt("Now do skunks")
print(response2.text())
```
You will get back five fun facts about skunks.

Access `conversation.responses` for a list of all of the responses that have so far been returned during the conversation.

# Setup

## Installation

Install this tool using `pip`:
```bash
pip install llm
```
Or using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):
```bash
pipx install llm
```
Or using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash
brew install llm
```

## Upgrading to the latest version

If you installed using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -U llm
```
For `pipx`:
```bash
pipx upgrade llm
```
For Homebrew:
```bash
brew upgrade llm
```

## Installing plugins

{ref}`plugins` can be used to add support for other language models, including models that can run on your own device.

For example, the [llm-gpt4all](https://github.com/simonw/llm-gpt4all) plugin adds support for 17 new models that can be installed on your own machine. You can install that like so:
```bash
llm install llm-gpt4all
```

(api-keys)=
## API key management

Many LLM models require an API key. These API keys can be provided to this tool using several different mechanisms.

You can obtain an API key for OpenAI's language models from [the API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) on their site.

### Saving and using stored keys

The easiest way to store an API key is to use the `llm keys set` command:

```bash
llm keys set openai
```
You will be prompted to enter the key like this:
```
% llm keys set openai
Enter key:
```
Once stored, this key will be automatically used for subsequent calls to the API:

```bash
llm "Five ludicrous names for a pet lobster"
```
Keys that are stored in this way live in a file called `keys.json`. This file is located at the path shown when you run the following command:

```bash
llm keys path
```
On macOS this will be `~/Library/Application Support/io.datasette.llm/keys.json`. On Linux it may be something like `~/.config/io.datasette.llm/keys.json`.

### Passing keys using the --key option

Keys can be passed directly using the `--key` option, like this:

```bash
llm "Five names for pet weasels" --key sk-my-key-goes-here
```
You can also pass the alias of a key stored in the `keys.json` file. For example, if you want to maintain a personal API key you could add that like this:
```bash
llm keys set personal
```
And then use it for prompts like so:

```bash
llm "Five friendly names for a pet skunk" --key personal
```

### Keys in environment variables

Keys can also be set using an environment variable. These are different for different models.

For OpenAI models the key will be read from the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

The environment variable will be used only if no `--key` option is passed to the command.

If no environment variable is found, the tool will fall back to checking `keys.json`.

You can force the tool to use the key from `keys.json` even if an environment variable has also been set using `llm "prompt" --key openai`.

## Configuration

You can configure LLM in a number of different ways.

### Setting a custom default model

The model used when calling `llm` without the `-m/--model` option defaults to `gpt-3.5-turbo` - the fastest and least expensive OpenAI model, and the same model family that powers ChatGPT.

You can use the `llm models default` command to set a different default model. For GPT-4 (slower and more expensive, but more capable) run this:

```bash
llm models default gpt-4
```
You can view the current model by running this:
```
llm models default
```
Any of the supported aliases for a model can be passed to this command.

### Setting a custom directory location

This tool stores various files - prompt templates, stored keys, preferences, a database of logs - in a directory on your computer.

On macOS this is `~/Library/Application Support/io.datasette.llm/`.

On Linux it may be something like `~/.config/io.datasette.llm/`.

You can set a custom location for this directory by setting the `LLM_USER_PATH` environment variable:

```bash
export LLM_USER_PATH=/path/to/my/custom/directory
```
### Turning SQLite logging on and off

By default, LLM will log every prompt and response you make to a SQLite database - see {ref}`logging` for more details.

You can turn this behavior off by default by running:
```bash
llm logs off
```
Or turn it back on again with:
```
llm logs on
```
Run `llm logs status` to see the current states of the setting.

(prompt-templates)=
# Prompt templates

Prompt templates can be created to reuse useful prompts with different input data.

## Getting started

The easiest way to create a template is using the `--save template_name` option.

Here's how to create a template for summarizing text:

```bash
llm 'Summarize this: $input' --save summarize
```
You can also create templates using system prompts:
```bash
llm --system 'Summarize this' --save summarize
```
You can set the default model for a template using `--model`:

```bash
llm --system 'Summarize this' --model gpt-4 --save summarize
```
You can also save default parameters:
```bash
llm --system 'Summarize this text in the voice of $voice' \
  --model gpt-4 -p voice GlaDOS --save summarize
```

## Using a template

You can execute a named template using the `-t/--template` option:

```bash
curl -s https://example.com/ | llm -t summarize
```

This can be combined with the `-m` option to specify a different model:
```bash
curl -s https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/ | \
  llm -t summarize -m gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
```

## Templates as YAML files

Templates are stored as YAML files on disk.

You can edit (or create) a YAML file for a template using the `llm templates edit` command:
```
llm templates edit summarize
```
This will open the system default editor.

:::{tip}
You can control which editor will be used here using the `EDITOR` environment variable - for example, to use VS Code:

    export EDITOR="code -w"

Add that to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` file depending on which shell you use (`zsh` is the default on macOS since macOS Catalina in 2019).
:::

You can also create a file called `summary.yaml` in the folder shown by running `llm templates path`, for example:
```bash
$ llm templates path
/Users/simon/Library/Application Support/io.datasette.llm/templates
```

You can also represent this template as a YAML dictionary with a `prompt:` key, like this one:

```yaml
prompt: 'Summarize this: $input'
```
Or use YAML multi-line strings for longer inputs. I created this using `llm templates edit steampunk`:
```yaml
prompt: >
    Summarize the following text.

    Insert frequent satirical steampunk-themed illustrative anecdotes.
    Really go wild with that.

    Text to summarize: $input
```
The `prompt: >` causes the following indented text to be treated as a single string, with newlines collapsed to spaces. Use `prompt: |` to preserve newlines.

Running that with `llm -t steampunk` against GPT-4 (via [strip-tags](https://github.com/simonw/strip-tags) to remove HTML tags from the input and minify whitespace):
```bash
curl -s 'https://til.simonwillison.net/macos/imovie-slides-and-audio' | \
  strip-tags -m | llm -t steampunk -m 4
```
Output:
> In a fantastical steampunk world, Simon Willison decided to merge an old MP3 recording with slides from the talk using iMovie. After exporting the slides as images and importing them into iMovie, he had to disable the default Ken Burns effect using the "Crop" tool. Then, Simon manually synchronized the audio by adjusting the duration of each image. Finally, he published the masterpiece to YouTube, with the whimsical magic of steampunk-infused illustrations leaving his viewers in awe.

## System templates

When working with models that support system prompts (such as `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4`) you can set a system prompt using a `system:` key like so:

```yaml
system: Summarize this
```
If you specify only a system prompt you don't need to use the `$input` variable - `llm` will use the user's input as the whole of the regular prompt, which will then be processed using the instructions set in that system prompt.

You can combine system and regular prompts like so:

```yaml
system: You speak like an excitable Victorian adventurer
prompt: 'Summarize this: $input'
```

## Additional template variables

Templates that work against the user's normal input (content that is either piped to the tool via standard input or passed as a command-line argument) use just the `$input` variable.

You can use additional named variables. These will then need to be provided using the `-p/--param` option when executing the template.

Here's an example template called `recipe`, created using `llm templates edit recipe`:

```yaml
prompt: |
    Suggest a recipe using ingredients: $ingredients

    It should be based on cuisine from this country: $country
```
This can be executed like so:

```bash
llm -t recipe -p ingredients 'sausages, milk' -p country Germany
```
My output started like this:
> Recipe: German Sausage and Potato Soup
>
> Ingredients:
> - 4 German sausages
> - 2 cups whole milk

This example combines input piped to the tool with additional parameters. Call this `summarize`:

```yaml
system: Summarize this text in the voice of $voice
```
Then to run it:
```bash
curl -s 'https://til.simonwillison.net/macos/imovie-slides-and-audio' | \
  strip-tags -m | llm -t summarize -p voice GlaDOS
```
I got this:

> My previous test subject seemed to have learned something new about iMovie. They exported keynote slides as individual images [...] Quite impressive for a human.

(prompt-default-parameters)=
## Specifying default parameters

You can also specify default values for parameters, using a `defaults:` key.

```yaml
system: Summarize this text in the voice of $voice
defaults:
  voice: GlaDOS
```

When running without `-p` it will choose the default:

```bash
curl -s 'https://til.simonwillison.net/macos/imovie-slides-and-audio' | \
  strip-tags -m | llm -t summarize
```

But you can override the defaults with `-p`:

```bash
curl -s 'https://til.simonwillison.net/macos/imovie-slides-and-audio' | \
  strip-tags -m | llm -t summarize -p voice Yoda
```

I got this:

> Text, summarize in Yoda's voice, I will: "Hmm, young padawan. Summary of this text, you seek. Hmmm. ...

## Setting a default model for a template

Templates executed using `llm -t template-name` will execute using the default model that the user has configured for the tool - or `gpt-3.5-turbo` if they have not configured their own default.

You can specify a new default model for a template using the `model:` key in the associated YAML. Here's a template called `roast`:

```yaml
model: gpt-4
system: roast the user at every possible opportunity, be succinct

# Usage

The default command for this is `llm prompt` - you can use `llm` instead if you prefer.

## Executing a prompt against OpenAI

To run a prompt, streaming tokens as they come in:
```bash
llm 'Ten names for cheesecakes'
```
To disable streaming and only return the response once it has completed:
```bash
llm 'Ten names for cheesecakes' --no-stream
```
To switch from ChatGPT 3.5 (the default) to GPT-4 if you have access:
```bash
llm 'Ten names for cheesecakes' -m gpt4
```
You can use `-m 4` as an even shorter shortcut.

Pass `--model <model name>` to use a different model.

You can also send a prompt to standard input, for example:
```bash
echo 'Ten names for cheesecakes' | llm
```
Some models support options. You can pass these using `-o/--option name value` - for example, to set the temperature to 1.5 run this:

```bash
llm 'Ten names for cheesecakes' -o temperature 1.5
```

## Continuing a conversation

By default, the tool will start a new conversation each time you run it.

You can opt to continue the previous conversation by passing the `-c/--continue` option:
```bash
llm 'More names' --continue
```
This will re-send the prompts and responses for the previous conversation as part of the call to the language model. Note that this can add up quickly in terms of tokens, especially if you are using expensive models.

`--continue` will automatically use the same model as the conversation that you are continuing, even if you omit the `-m/--model` option.

To continue a conversation that is not the most recent one, use the `--cid/--conversation <id>` option:
```bash
llm 'More names' --cid 01h53zma5txeby33t1kbe3xk8q
```
You can find these conversation IDs using the `llm logs` command.

## Using with a shell

To generate a description of changes made to a Git repository since the last commit:
```bash
llm "Describe these changes: $(git diff)"
```
This pattern of using `$(command)` inside a double quoted string is a useful way to quickly assemble prompts.

## System prompts

You can use `-s/--system '...'` to set a system prompt.
```bash
llm 'SQL to calculate total sales by month' \
  --system 'You are an exaggerated sentient cheesecake that knows SQL and talks about cheesecake a lot'
```
This is useful for piping content to standard input, for example:
```bash
curl -s 'https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/15/per-interpreter-gils/' | \
  llm -s 'Suggest topics for this post as a JSON array'
```
## Listing available models

The `llm models list` command lists every model that can be used with LLM, along with any aliases:

```bash
llm models list
```
Example output:
```
OpenAI Chat: gpt-3.5-turbo (aliases: 3.5, chatgpt)
OpenAI Chat: gpt-3.5-turbo-16k (aliases: chatgpt-16k, 3.5-16k)
OpenAI Chat: gpt-4 (aliases: 4, gpt4)
OpenAI Chat: gpt-4-32k (aliases: 4-32k)
PaLM 2: chat-bison-001 (aliases: palm, palm2)
```
Add `--options` to also see documentation for the options supported by each model:
```bash
llm models list --options
```
Output:
<!-- [[[cog
from click.testing import CliRunner
from llm.cli import cli
result = CliRunner().invoke(cli, ["models", "list", "--options"])
cog.out("```\n{}\n```".format(result.output))
]]] -->
```
OpenAI Chat: gpt-3.5-turbo (aliases: 3.5, chatgpt)
  temperature: float
    What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like
    0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will
    make it more focused and deterministic.
  max_tokens: int
    Maximum number of tokens to generate.
  top_p: float
    An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling,
    where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p
    probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10%
    probability mass are considered. Recommended to use top_p or
    temperature but not both.
  frequency_penalty: float
    Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based
    on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's
    likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
  presence_penalty: float
    Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based
    on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's
    likelihood to talk about new topics.
  stop: str
    A string where the API will stop generating further tokens.
  logit_bias: dict, str
    Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.
    Pass a JSON string like '{"1712":-100, "892":-100, "1489":-100}'
OpenAI Chat: gpt-3.5-turbo-16k (aliases: chatgpt-16k, 3.5-16k)
  temperature: float
  max_tokens: int
  top_p: float
  frequency_penalty: float
  presence_penalty: float
  stop: str
  logit_bias: dict, str
OpenAI Chat: gpt-4 (aliases: 4, gpt4)
  temperature: float
  max_tokens: int
  top_p: float
  frequency_penalty: float
  presence_penalty: float
  stop: str
  logit_bias: dict, str
OpenAI Chat: gpt-4-32k (aliases: 4-32k)
  temperature: float
  max_tokens: int
  top_p: float
  frequency_penalty: float
  presence_penalty: float
  stop: str
  logit_bias: dict, str

```
<!-- [[[end]]] -->

When running a prompt you can pass the full model name or any of the aliases to the `-m/--model` option:
```bash
llm -m chatgpt-16k 'As many names for cheesecakes as you can think of, with detailed descriptions'
```
Models that have been installed using plugins will be shown here as well.
