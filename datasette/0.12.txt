Changelog
=========

0.12
----
- Added ``__version__``, now displayed as tooltip in page footer (`#108`_).
- Added initial docs, including a changelog (`#99`_).
- Turned on auto-escaping in Jinja.
- Added a UI for editing named parameters (`#96`_).
- Pin to specific Jinja version. (`#100`_).
- Default to 127.0.0.1 not 0.0.0.0. (`#98`_).
- Added extra metadata options to publish and package commands. (`#92`_).

  You can now run these commands like so::

      datasette now publish mydb.db \
          --title="My Title" \
          --source="Source" \
          --source_url="http://www.example.com/" \
          --license="CC0" \
          --license_url="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"

  This will write those values into the metadata.json that is packaged with the
  app. If you also pass ``--metadata=metadata.json`` that file will be updated with the extra
  values before being written into the Docker image.
- Added simple production-ready Dockerfile (`#94`_) [Andrew
  Cutler]
- New ``?_sql_time_limit_ms=10`` argument to database and table page (`#95`_)
- SQL syntax highlighting with Codemirror (`#89`_) [Tom Dyson]

0.11 (2017-11-14)
-----------------
- Added ``datasette publish now --force`` option.

  This calls ``now`` with ``--force`` - useful as it means you get a fresh copy of datasette even if Now has already cached that docker layer.
- Enable ``--cors`` by default when running in a container.

0.10 (2017-11-14)
-----------------
- Fixed `#83`_ - 500 error on individual row pages.
- Stop using sqlite WITH RECURSIVE in our tests.

  The version of Python 3 running in Travis CI doesn't support this.

.. _#83: https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/83

0.9 (2017-11-13)
----------------
- Added ``--sql_time_limit_ms`` and ``--extra-options``.

  The serve command now accepts ``--sql_time_limit_ms`` for customizing the SQL time
  limit.

  The publish and package commands now accept ``--extra-options`` which can be used
  to specify additional options to be passed to the datasite serve command when
  it executes inside the resulting Docker containers.

0.8 (2017-11-13)
----------------
- V0.8 - added PyPI metadata, ready to ship.
- Implemented offset/limit pagination for views (`#70`_).
- Improved pagination. (`#78`_)
- Limit on max rows returned, controlled by ``--max_returned_rows`` option. (`#69`_)

  If someone executes 'select * from table' against a table with a million rows
  in it, we could run into problems: just serializing that much data as JSON is
  likely to lock up the server.

  Solution: we now have a hard limit on the maximum number of rows that can be
  returned by a query. If that limit is exceeded, the server will return a
  ``"truncated": true`` field in the JSON.

  This limit can be optionally controlled by the new ``--max_returned_rows``
  option. Setting that option to 0 disables the limit entirely.

Datasette
=========

*An instant JSON API for your SQLite databases*

Datasette provides an instant, read-only JSON API for any SQLite
database. It also provides tools for packaging the database up as a
Docker container and deploying that container to hosting providers such
as `Zeit Now`_.

Some examples: https://github.com/simonw/datasette/wiki/Datasettes

Contents
--------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   changelog

Getting started
---------------

::

    pip3 install datasette

Datasette requires Python 3.5 or higher.

Basic usage
-----------

::

    datasette serve path/to/database.db

This will start a web server on port 8001 - visit http://localhost:8001/
to access the web interface.

``serve`` is the default subcommand, you can omit it if you like.

Use Chrome on OS X? You can run datasette against your browser history
like so:

::

     datasette ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History

Now visiting http://localhost:8001/History/downloads will show you a web
interface to browse your downloads data:

.. figure:: https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2017/datasette-downloads.png
   :alt: Downloads table rendered by datasette

http://localhost:8001/History/downloads.json will return that data as
JSON:

::

    {
        "database": "History",
        "columns": [
            "id",
            "current_path",
            "target_path",
            "start_time",
            "received_bytes",
            "total_bytes",
            ...
        ],
        "table_rows": 576,
        "rows": [
            [
                1,
                "/Users/simonw/Downloads/DropboxInstaller.dmg",
                "/Users/simonw/Downloads/DropboxInstaller.dmg",
                13097290269022132,
                626688,
                0,
                ...
            ]
        ]
    }

http://localhost:8001/History/downloads.jsono will return that data as
JSON in a more convenient but less efficient format:

::

    {
        ...
        "rows": [
            {
                "start_time": 13097290269022132,
                "interrupt_reason": 0,
                "hash": "",
                "id": 1,
                "site_url": "",
                "referrer": "https://www.dropbox.com/downloading?src=index",
                ...
            }
        ]
    }

datasette serve options
-----------------------

::

    $ datasette serve --help
    Usage: datasette serve [OPTIONS] [FILES]...

      Serve up specified SQLite database files with a web UI

    Options:
      -h, --host TEXT              host for server, defaults to 127.0.0.1
      -p, --port INTEGER           port for server, defaults to 8001
      --debug                      Enable debug mode - useful for development
      --reload                     Automatically reload if code change detected -
                                   useful for development
      --cors                       Enable CORS by
