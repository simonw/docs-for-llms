Changelog
=========

0.13 (2017-11-24)
-----------------
- Search now applies to current filters.

  Combined search into the same form as filters.

  Closes `#133`_

- Much tidier design for table view header.

  Closes `#147`_

- Added ``?column__not=blah`` filter.

  Closes `#148`_

- Row page now resolves foreign keys.

  Closes `#132`_

- Further tweaks to select/input filter styling.

  Refs `#86`_ - thanks for the help, @natbat!

- Show linked foreign key in table cells.

- Added UI for editing table filters.

  Refs `#86`_

- Hide FTS-created tables on index pages.

  Closes `#129`_

- Add publish to heroku support [Jacob Kaplan-Moss]

  ``datasette publish heroku mydb.db``

  Pull request `#104`_

- Initial implementation of ``?_group_count=column``.

  URL shortcut for counting rows grouped by one or more columns.

  ``?_group_count=column1&_group_count=column2`` works as well.

  SQL generated looks like this::

      select "qSpecies", count(*) as "count"
      from Street_Tree_List
      group by "qSpecies"
      order by "count" desc limit 100

  Or for two columns like this::

      select "qSpecies", "qSiteInfo", count(*) as "count"
      from Street_Tree_List
      group by "qSpecies", "qSiteInfo"
      order by "count" desc limit 100

  Refs `#44`_

- Added ``--build=master`` option to datasette publish and package.

  The ``datasette publish`` and ``datasette package`` commands both now accept an
  optional ``--build`` argument. If provided, this can be used to specify a branch
  published to GitHub that should be built into the container.

  This makes it easier to test code that has not yet been officially released to
  PyPI, e.g.::

      datasette publish now mydb.db --branch=master

- Implemented ``?_search=XXX`` + UI if a FTS table is detected.

  Closes `#131`_

- Added ``datasette --version`` support.

- Table views now show expanded foreign key references, if possible.
 
  If a table has foreign key columns, and those foreign key tables have
  ``label_columns``, the TableView will now query those other tables for the
  corresponding values and display those values as links in the corresponding
  table cells.

  label_columns are currently detected by the ``inspect()`` function, which looks
  for any table that has just two columns - an ID column and one other - and
  sets the ``label_column`` to be that second non-ID column.

- Don't prevent tabbing to "Run SQL" button (`#117`_) [Robert Gieseke]

  See comment in `#115`_

- Add keyboard shortcut to execute SQL query (`#115`_) [Robert Gieseke]

- Allow ``--load-extension`` to be set via environment variable.

- Add support for ``?field__isnull=1`` (`#107`_) [Ray N]

- Add spatialite, switch to debian and local build (`#114`_) [Ariel Núñez]

- Added ``--load-extension`` argument to datasette serve.

  Allows loading of SQLite extensions. Refs `#110`_.

0.12 (2017-11-16)
-----------------
- Added ``__version__``, now displayed as tooltip in page footer (`#108`_).
- Added initial docs, including a changelog (`#99`_).
- Turned on auto-escaping in Jinja.
- Added a UI for editing named parameters (`#96`_).

  You can now construct a custom SQL statement using SQLite named
  parameters (e.g. ``:name``) and datasette will display form fields for
  editing those parameters. `Here’s an example`_ which lets you see the
  most popular names for dogs of different species registered through
  various dog registration schemes in Australia.

.. _Here’s an example: https://australian-dogs.now.sh/australian-dogs-3ba9628?sql=select+name%2C+count%28*%29+as+n+from+%28%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22Animal+name%22%29+as+name+from+%5BAdelaide-City-Council-dog-registrations-2013%5D+where+Breed+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28Animal_Name%29+as+name+from+%5BAdelaide-City-Council-dog-registrations-2014%5D+where+Breed_Description+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all+%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28Animal_Name%29+as+name+from+%5BAdelaide-City-Council-dog-registrations-2015%5D+where+Breed_Description+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22AnimalName%22%29+as+name+from+%5BCity-of-Port-Adelaide-Enfield-Dog_Registrations_2016%5D+where+AnimalBreed+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22Animal+Name%22%29+as+name+from+%5BMitcham-dog-registrations-2015%5D+where+Breed+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22DOG_NAME%22%29+as+name+from+%5Bburnside-dog-registrations-2015%5D+where+DOG_BREED+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all+%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22Animal_Name%22%29+as+name+from+%5Bcity-of-playford-2015-dog-registration%5D+where+Breed_Description+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22Animal+Name%22%29+as+name+from+%5Bcity-of-prospect-dog-registration-details-2016%5D+where%22Breed+Description%22+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0A%29+group+by+name+order+by+n+desc%3B&breed=pug

- Pin to specific Jinja version. (`#100`_).
- Default to 127.0.0.1 not 0.0.0.0. (`#98`_).
- Added extra metadata options to publish and package commands. (`#92`_).

  You can now run these commands like so::

      datasette now publish mydb.db \
          --title="My Title" \
          --source="Source" \
          --source_url="http://www.example.com/" \
          --license="CC0" \
          --license_url="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"

  This will write those values into the metadata.json that is packaged with the
  app. If you also pass ``--metadata=metadata.json`` that file will be updated with the extra
  values before being written into the Docker image.
- Added simple production-ready Dockerfile (`#94`_) [Andrew
  Cutler]
- New ``?_sql_time_limit_ms=10`` argument to database and table page (`#95`_)
- SQL syntax highlighting with Codemirror (`#89`_) [Tom Dyson]

0.11 (2017-11-14)
-----------------
- Added ``datasette publish now --force`` option.

  This calls ``now`` with ``--force`` - useful as it means you get a fresh copy of datasette even if Now has already cached that docker layer.
- Enable ``--cors`` by default when running in a container.

0.10 (2017-11-14)
-----------------
- Fixed `#83`_ - 500 error on individual row pages.
- Stop using sqlite WITH RECURSIVE in our tests.

  The version of Python 3 running in Travis CI doesn't support this.

.. _#83: https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/83

0.9 (2017-11-13)
----------------
- Added ``--sql_time_limit_ms`` and ``--extra-options``.

  The serve command now accepts ``--sql_time_limit_ms`` for customizing the SQL time
  limit.

  The publish and package commands now accept ``--extra-options`` which can be used
  to specify additional options to be passed to the datasite serve command when
  it executes inside the resulting Docker containers.

0.8 (2017-11-13)
----------------
- V0.8 - added PyPI metadata, ready to ship.
- Implemented offset/limit pagination for views (`#70`_).
- Improved pagination. (`#78`_)
- Limit on max rows returned, controlled by ``--max_returned_rows`` option. (`#69`_)

  If someone executes 'select * from table' against a table with a million rows
  in it, we could run into problems: just serializing that much data as JSON is
  likely to lock up the server.

  Solution: we now have a hard limit on the maximum number of rows that can be
  returned by a query. If that limit is exceeded, the server will return a
  ``"truncated": true`` field in the JSON.

  This limit can be optionally controlled by the new ``--max_returned_rows``
  option. Setting that option to 0 disables the limit entirely.

Datasette
=========

*An instant JSON API for your SQLite databases*

Datasette provides an instant, read-only JSON API for any SQLite
database. It also provides tools for packaging the database up as a
Docker container and deploying that container to hosting providers such
as `Zeit Now`_.

Some examples: https://github.com/simonw/datasette/wiki/Datasettes

Contents
--------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   changelog

Getting started
---------------

::

    pip3 install datasette

Datasette requires Python 3.5 or higher.

Basic usage
-----------

::

    datasette serve path/to/database.db

This will start a web server on port 8001 - visit http://localhost:8001/
to access the web interface.

``serve`` is the default subcommand, you can omit it if you like.

Use Chrome on OS X? You can run datasette against your browser history
like so:

::

     datasette ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History

Now visiting http://localhost:8001/History/downloads will show you a web
interface to browse your downloads data:

.. figure:: https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2017/datasette-downloads.png
   :alt: Downloads table rendered by datasette

http://localhost:8001/History/downloads.json will return that data as
JSON:

::

    {
        "database": "History",
        "columns": [
            "id",
            "current_path",
            "target_path",
            "start_time",
            "received_bytes",
            "total_bytes",
            ...
        ],
        "table_rows": 576,
        "rows": [
            [
                1,
                "/Users/simonw/Downloads/DropboxInstaller.dmg",
                "/Users/simonw/Downloads/DropboxInstaller.dmg",
                13097290269022132,
                626688,
                0,
                ...
            ]
        ]
    }

http://localhost:8001/History/downloads.jsono will return that data as
JSON in a more convenient but less efficient format:

::

    {
        ...
        "rows": [
            {
                "start_time": 13097290269022132,
                "interrupt_reason": 0,
                "hash": "",
                "id": 1,
                "site_url": "",
                "referrer": "https://www.dropbox.com/downloading?src=index",
                ...
            }
        ]
    }
