0.29 (2019-07-07)
-----------------

ASGI, new plugin hooks, facet by date and much, much more...

ASGI
~~~~

`ASGI <https://asgi.readthedocs.io/>`__ is the Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface standard. I've been wanting to convert Datasette into an ASGI application for over a year - `Port Datasette to ASGI #272 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/272>`__ tracks thirteen months of intermittent development - but with Datasette 0.29 the change is finally released. This also means Datasette now runs on top of `Uvicorn <https://www.uvicorn.org/>`__ and no longer depends on `Sanic <https://github.com/huge-success/sanic>`__.

I wrote about the significance of this change in `Porting Datasette to ASGI, and Turtles all the way down <https://simonwillison.net/2019/Jun/23/datasette-asgi/>`__.

The most exciting consequence of this change is that Datasette plugins can now take advantage of the ASGI standard.

New plugin hook: asgi_wrapper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`plugin_asgi_wrapper` plugin hook allows plugins to entirely wrap the Datasette ASGI application in their own ASGI middleware. (`#520 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/520>`__)

Two new plugins take advantage of this hook:

* `datasette-auth-github <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-github>`__ adds a authentication layer: users will have to sign in using their GitHub account before they can view data or interact with Datasette. You can also use it to restrict access to specific GitHub users, or to members of specified GitHub `organizations <https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-organizations>`__ or `teams <https://help.github.com/en/articles/organizing-members-into-teams>`__.

* `datasette-cors <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cors>`__ allows you to configure `CORS headers <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS>`__ for your Datasette instance. You can use this to enable JavaScript running on a whitelisted set of domains to make ``fetch()`` calls to the JSON API provided by your Datasette instance.

New plugin hook: extra_template_vars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`plugin_hook_extra_template_vars` plugin hook allows plugins to inject their own additional variables into the Datasette template context. This can be used in conjunction with custom templates to customize the Datasette interface. `datasette-auth-github <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-github>`__ uses this hook to add custom HTML to the new top navigation bar (which is designed to be modified by plugins, see `#540 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/540>`__).

Secret plugin configuration options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plugins like `datasette-auth-github <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-github>`__ need a safe way to set secret configuration options. Since the default mechanism for configuring plugins exposes those settings in ``/-/metadata`` a new mechanism was needed. :ref:`plugins_configuration_secret` describes how plugins can now specify that their settings should be read from a file or an environment variable::

    {
        "plugins": {
            "datasette-auth-github": {
                "client_secret": {
                    "$env": "GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET"
                }
            }
        }
    }

These plugin secrets can be set directly using ``datasette publish``. See :ref:`publish_custom_metadata_and_plugins` for details. (`#538 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/538>`__ and `#543 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/543>`__)

Facet by date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a column contains datetime values, Datasette can now facet that column by date. (`#481 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/481>`__)

.. _v0_29_medium_changes:

Easier custom templates for table rows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to customize the display of individual table rows, you can do so using a ``_table.html`` template include that looks something like this::

    {% for row in display_rows %}
        <div>
            <h2>{{ row["title"] }}</h2>
            <p>{{ row["description"] }}<lp>
            <p>Category: {{ row.display("category_id") }}</p>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}

This is a **backwards incompatible change**. If you previously had a custom template called ``_rows_and_columns.html`` you need to rename it to ``_table.html``.

See :ref:`customization_custom_templates` for full details.

?_through= for joins through many-to-many tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new ``?_through={json}`` argument to the Table view allows records to be filtered based on a many-to-many relationship. See :ref:`json_api_table_arguments` for full documentation - here's `an example <https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/roadside_attractions?_through={%22table%22:%22roadside_attraction_characteristics%22,%22column%22:%22characteristic_id%22,%22value%22:%221%22}>`__. (`#355 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/355>`__)

This feature was added to help support `facet by many-to-many <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/551>`__, which isn't quite ready yet but will be coming in the next Datasette release.

Small changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Databases published using ``datasette publish`` now open in :ref:`performance_immutable_mode`. (`#469 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/469>`__)
* ``?col__date=`` now works for columns containing spaces
* Automatic label detection (for deciding which column to show when linking to a foreign key) has been improved. (`#485 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/485>`__)
* Fixed bug where pagination broke when combined with an expanded foreign key. (`#489 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/489>`__)
* Contributors can now run ``pip install -e .[docs]`` to get all of the dependencies needed to build the documentation, including ``cd docs && make livehtml`` support.
* Datasette's dependencies are now all specified using the ``~=`` match operator. (`#532 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/532>`__)
* ``white-space: pre-wrap`` now used for table creation SQL. (`#505 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/505>`__)


`Full list of commits <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/compare/0.28...0.29>`__ between 0.28 and 0.29.

.. _v0_28:

0.28 (2019-05-19)
-----------------

A `salmagundi <https://adamj.eu/tech/2019/01/18/a-salmagundi-of-django-alpha-announcements/>`__ of new features! 

.. _v0_28_databases_that_change:

Supporting databases that change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the beginning of the project, Datasette has been designed with read-only databases in mind. If a database is guaranteed not to change it opens up all kinds of interesting opportunities - from taking advantage of SQLite immutable mode and HTTP caching to bundling static copies of the database directly in a Docker container. `The interesting ideas in Datasette <https://simonwillison.net/2018/Oct/4/datasette-ideas/>`__ explores this idea in detail.

As my goals for the project have developed, I realized that read-only databases are no longer the right default. SQLite actually supports concurrent access very well provided only one thread attempts to write to a database at a time, and I keep encountering sensible use-cases for running Datasette on top of a database that is processing inserts and updates.

So, as-of version 0.28 Datasette no longer assumes that a database file will not change. It is now safe to point Datasette at a SQLite database which is being updated by another process.

Making this change was a lot of work - see tracking tickets `#418 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/418>`__, `#419 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/419>`__ and `#420 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/420>`__. It required new thinking around how Datasette should calculate table counts (an expensive operation against a large, changing database) and also meant reconsidering the "content hash" URLs Datasette has used in the past to optimize the performance of HTTP caches.

Datasette can still run against immutable files and gains numerous performance benefits from doing so, but this is no longer the default behaviour. Take a look at the new :ref:`performance` documentation section for details on how to make the most of Datasette against data that you know will be staying read-only and immutable.

.. _v0_28_faceting:

Faceting improvements, and faceting plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datasette :ref:`facets` provide an intuitive way to quickly summarize and interact with data. Previously the only supported faceting technique was column faceting, but 0.28 introduces two powerful new capabilities: facet-by-JSON-array and the ability to define further facet types using plugins.

Facet by array (`#359 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/359>`__) is only available if your SQLite installation provides the ``json1`` extension. Datasette will automatically detect columns that contain JSON arrays of values and offer a faceting interface against those columns - useful for modelling things like tags without needing to break them out into a new table. See :ref:`facet_by_json_array` for more.

The new :ref:`plugin_register_facet_classes` plugin hook (`#445 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/445>`__) can be used to register additional custom facet classes. Each facet class should provide two methods: ``suggest()`` which suggests facet selections that might be appropriate for a provided SQL query, and ``facet_results()`` which executes a facet operation and returns results. Datasette's own faceting implementations have been refactored to use the same API as these plugins.

.. _v0_28_publish_cloudrun:

datasette publish cloudrun
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Google Cloud Run <https://cloud.google.com/run/>`__ is a brand new serverless hosting platform from Google, which allows you to build a Docker container which will run only when HTTP traffic is received and will shut down (and hence cost you nothing) the rest of the time. It's similar to Zeit's Now v1 Docker hosting platform which sadly is `no longer accepting signups <https://hyperion.alpha.spectrum.chat/zeit/now/cannot-create-now-v1-deployments~d206a0d4-5835-4af5-bb5c-a17f0171fb25?m=MTU0Njk2NzgwODM3OA==>`__ from new users.

The new ``datasette publish cloudrun`` command was contributed by Romain Primet (`#434 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/434>`__) and publishes selected databases to a new Datasette instance running on Google Cloud Run.

See :ref:`publish_cloud_run` for full documentation.

.. _v0_28_register_output_renderer:

register_output_renderer plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Russ Garrett implemented a new Datasette plugin hook called :ref:`register_output_renderer <plugin_register_output_renderer>` (`#441 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/441>`__) which allows plugins to create additional output renderers in addition to Datasette's default ``.json`` and ``.csv``.

Russ's in-development `datasette-geo <https://github.com/russss/datasette-geo>`__ plugin includes `an example <https://github.com/russss/datasette-geo/blob/d4cecc020848bbde91e9e17bf352f7c70bc3dccf/datasette_plugin_geo/geojson.py>`__ of this hook being used to output ``.geojson`` automatically converted from SpatiaLite.

.. _v0_28_medium_changes:

Medium changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Datasette now conforms to the `Black coding style <https://github.com/python/black>`__ (`#449 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/449>`__) - and has a unit test to enforce this in the future
- New :ref:`json_api_table_arguments`:
   - ``?columnname__in=value1,value2,value3`` filter for executing SQL IN queries against a table, see :ref:`table_arguments` (`#433 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/433>`__)
   - ``?columnname__date=yyyy-mm-dd`` filter which returns rows where the spoecified datetime column falls on the specified date (`583b22a <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/583b22aa28e26c318de0189312350ab2688c90b1>`__)
   - ``?tags__arraycontains=tag`` filter which acts against a JSON array contained in a column (`78e45ea <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/78e45ead4d771007c57b307edf8fc920101f8733>`__)
   - ``?_where=sql-fragment`` filter for the table view  (`#429 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/429>`__)
   - ``?_fts_table=mytable`` and ``?_fts_pk=mycolumn`` querystring options can be used to specify which FTS table to use for a search query - see :ref:`full_text_search_table_or_view` (`#428 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/428>`__)
- You can now pass the same table filter multiple times - for example, ``?content__not=world&content__not=hello`` will return all rows where the content column is neither ``hello`` or ``world`` (`#288 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/288>`__)
- You can now specify ``about`` and ``about_url`` metadata (in addition to ``source`` and ``license``) linking to further information about a project - see :ref:`metadata_source_license_about`
- New ``?_trace=1`` parameter now adds debug information showing every SQL query that was executed while constructing the page (`#435 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/435>`__)
- ``datasette inspect`` now just calculates table counts, and does not introspect other database metadata (`#462 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/462>`__)
- Removed ``/-/inspect`` page entirely - this will be replaced by something similar in the future, see `#465 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/465>`__
- Datasette can now run against an in-memory SQLite database. You can do this by starting it without passing any files or by using the new ``--memory`` option to ``datasette serve``. This can be useful for experimenting with SQLite queries that do not access any data, such as ``SELECT 1+1`` or ``SELECT sqlite_version()``.

-------------------

Documentation improvements plus a fix for publishing to Zeit Now.

- ``datasette publish now`` now uses Zeit's v1 platform, to work around the new 100MB image limit. Thanks, @slygent - closes `#366 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/366>`__.

.. _v0_25:

0.25 (2018-09-19)
-----------------

New plugin hooks, improved database view support and an easier way to use more recent versions of SQLite.

- New ``publish_subcommand`` plugin hook. A plugin can now add additional ``datasette publish`` publishers in addition to the default ``now`` and ``heroku``, both of which have been refactored into default plugins. :ref:`publish_subcommand documentation <plugin_hook_publish_subcommand>`. Closes `#349 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/349>`__
- New ``render_cell`` plugin hook. Plugins can now customize how values are displayed in the HTML tables produced by Datasette's browseable interface. `datasette-json-html <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-json-html>`__ and `datasette-render-images <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-render-images>`__ are two new plugins that use this hook. :ref:`render_cell documentation <plugin_hook_render_cell>`. Closes `#352 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/352>`__
- New ``extra_body_script`` plugin hook, enabling plugins to provide additional JavaScript that should be added to the page footer. :ref:`extra_body_script documentation <plugin_hook_extra_body_script>`.
- ``extra_css_urls`` and ``extra_js_urls`` hooks now take additional optional parameters, allowing them to be more selective about which pages they apply to. :ref:`Documentation <plugin_hook_extra_css_urls>`.
- You can now use the :ref:`sortable_columns metadata setting <metadata_sortable_columns>` to explicitly enable sort-by-column in the interface for database views, as well as for specific tables.
- The new ``fts_table`` and ``fts_pk`` metadata settings can now be used to :ref:`explicitly configure full-text search for a table or a view <full_text_search_table_or_view>`, even if that table is not directly coupled to the SQLite FTS feature in the database schema itself.
- Datasette will now use `pysqlite3 <https://github.com/coleifer/pysqlite3>`__ in place of the standard library ``sqlite3`` module if it has been installed in the current environment. This makes it much easier to run Datasette against a more recent version of SQLite, including the just-released `SQLite 3.25.0 <https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_25_0.html>`__ which adds window function support. More details on how to use this in `#360 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/360>`__
- New mechanism that allows :ref:`plugin configuration options <plugins_configuration>` to be set using ``metadata.json``.

commits added since the last release.

CSV export
~~~~~~~~~~

Any Datasette table, view or custom SQL query can now be exported as CSV.

.. image:: advanced_export.png

Check out the :ref:`CSV export documentation <csv_export>` for more details, or
try the feature out on
https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight/bechdel%2Fmovies

If your table has more than :ref:`config_max_returned_rows` (default 1,000)
Datasette provides the option to *stream all rows*. This option takes advantage
of async Python and Datasette's efficient :ref:`pagination <pagination>` to
iterate through the entire matching result set and stream it back as a
downloadable CSV file.

Foreign key expansions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Datasette detects a foreign key reference it attempts to resolve a label
for that reference (automatically or using the :ref:`label_columns` metadata
option) so it can display a link to the associated row.

This expansion is now also available for JSON and CSV representations of the
table, using the new ``_labels=on`` querystring option. See
:ref:`expand_foreign_keys` for more details.

New configuration settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datasette's :ref:`config` now also supports boolean settings. A number of new
configuration options have been added:

* ``num_sql_threads`` - the number of threads used to execute SQLite queries. Defaults to 3.
* ``allow_facet`` - enable or disable custom :ref:`facets` using the `_facet=` parameter. Defaults to on.
* ``suggest_facets`` - should Datasette suggest facets? Defaults to on.
* ``allow_download`` - should users be allowed to download the entire SQLite database? Defaults to on.
* ``allow_sql`` - should users be allowed to execute custom SQL queries? Defaults to on.
* ``default_cache_ttl`` - Default HTTP caching max-age header in seconds. Defaults to 365 days - caching can be disabled entirely by settings this to 0.
* ``cache_size_kb`` - Set the amount of memory SQLite uses for its `per-connection cache <https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size>`_, in KB.
* ``allow_csv_stream`` - allow users to stream entire result sets as a single CSV file. Defaults to on.
* ``max_csv_mb`` - maximum size of a returned CSV file in MB. Defaults to 100MB, set to 0 to disable this limit.

Control HTTP caching with ?_ttl=
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can now customize the HTTP max-age header that is sent on a per-URL basis, using the new ``?_ttl=`` querystring parameter.

You can set this to any value in seconds, or you can set it to 0 to disable HTTP caching entirely.

Consider for example this query which returns a randomly selected member of the Avengers::

    select * from [avengers/avengers] order by random() limit 1

If you hit the following page repeatedly you will get the same result, due to HTTP caching:

`/fivethirtyeight?sql=select+*+from+%5Bavengers%2Favengers%5D+order+by+random%28%29+limit+1 <https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight?sql=select+*+from+%5Bavengers%2Favengers%5D+order+by+random%28%29+limit+1>`_

By adding `?_ttl=0` to the zero you can ensure the page will not be cached and get back a different super hero every time:

`/fivethirtyeight?sql=select+*+from+%5Bavengers%2Favengers%5D+order+by+random%28%29+limit+1&_ttl=0 <https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight?sql=select+*+from+%5Bavengers%2Favengers%5D+order+by+random%28%29+limit+1&_ttl=0>`_

Improved support for SpatiaLite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `SpatiaLite module <https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index>`_
for SQLite adds robust geospatial features to the database.

Getting SpatiaLite working can be tricky, especially if you want to use the most
recent alpha version (with support for K-nearest neighbor).

Datasette now includes :ref:`extensive documentation on SpatiaLite
<spatialite>`, and thanks to `Ravi Kotecha <https://github.com/r4vi>`_ our GitHub
repo includes a `Dockerfile
<https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/master/Dockerfile>`_ that can build
the latest SpatiaLite and configure it for use with Datasette.

The ``datasette publish`` and ``datasette package`` commands now accept a new
``--spatialite`` argument which causes them to install and configure SpatiaLite
as part of the container they deploy.

latest.datasette.io
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every commit to Datasette master is now automatically deployed by Travis CI to
https://latest.datasette.io/ - ensuring there is always a live demo of the
latest version of the software.

The demo uses `the fixtures
<https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/master/tests/fixtures.py>`_ from our
unit tests, ensuring it demonstrates the same range of functionality that is
covered by the tests.

You can see how the deployment mechanism works in our `.travis.yml
<https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/master/.travis.yml>`_ file.

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Got JSON data in one of your columns? Use the new ``?_json=COLNAME`` argument
  to tell Datasette to return that JSON value directly rather than encoding it
  as a string.
* If you just want an array of the first value of each row, use the new
  ``?_shape=arrayfirst`` option - `example
  <https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures.json?sql=select+neighborhood+from+facetable+order+by+pk+limit+101&_shape=arrayfirst>`_.

0.22.1 (2018-05-23)
-------------------

Bugfix release, plus we now use `versioneer <https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer>`_ for our version numbers.

- Faceting no longer breaks pagination, fixes `#282 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/282>`_
- Add ``__version_info__`` derived from `__version__` [Robert Gieseke]

  This might be tuple of more than two values (major and minor
  version) if commits have been made after a release.
- Add version number support with Versioneer. [Robert Gieseke]

  Versioneer Licence:
  Public Domain (CC0-1.0)

  Closes `#273 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/273>`_
- Refactor inspect logic [Russ Garrett]

0.22 (2018-05-20)
-----------------

The big new feature in this release is :ref:`facets`. Datasette can now apply faceted browse to any column in any table. It will also suggest possible facets. See the `Datasette Facets <https://simonwillison.net/2018/May/20/datasette-facets/>`_ announcement post for more details.

In addition to the work on facets:

- Added `docs for introspection endpoints <https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introspection.html>`_

- New ``--config`` option, added ``--help-config``, closes `#274 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/274>`_

  Removed the ``--page_size=`` argument to ``datasette serve`` in favour of::

      datasette serve --config default_page_size:50 mydb.db

  Added new help section::

      $ datasette --help-config
      Config options:
        default_page_size            Default page size for the table view
                                     (default=100)
        max_returned_rows            Maximum rows that can be returned from a table
                                     or custom query (default=1000)
        sql_time_limit_ms            Time limit for a SQL query in milliseconds
                                     (default=1000)
        default_facet_size           Number of values to return for requested facets
                                     (default=30)
        facet_time_limit_ms          Time limit for calculating a requested facet
                                     (default=200)
        facet_suggest_time_limit_ms  Time limit for calculating a suggested facet
                                     (default=50)
- Only apply responsive table styles to ``.rows-and-column``

  Otherwise they interfere with tables in the description, e.g. on
  https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight/nba-elo%2Fnbaallelo

- Refactored views into new ``views/`` modules, refs `#256 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/256>`_
- `Documentation for SQLite full-text search <http://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/full_text_search.html>`_ support, closes `#253 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/253>`_
- ``/-/versions`` now includes SQLite ``fts_versions``, closes `#252 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/252>`_

0.21 (2018-05-05)
-----------------

New JSON ``_shape=`` options, the ability to set table ``_size=`` and a mechanism for searching within specific columns.

- Default tests to using a longer timelimit

  Every now and then a test will fail in Travis CI on Python 3.5 because it hit
  the default 20ms SQL time limit.

  Test fixtures now default to a 200ms time limit, and we only use the 20ms time
  limit for the specific test that tests query interruption. This should make
  our tests on Python 3.5 in Travis much more stable.
- Support ``_search_COLUMN=text`` searches, closes `#237 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/237>`_
- Show version on ``/-/plugins`` page, closes `#248 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/248>`_
- ``?_size=max`` option, closes `#249 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/249>`_
- Added ``/-/versions`` and ``/-/versions.json``, closes `#244 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/244>`_

  Sample output::

      {
        "python": {
          "version": "3.6.3",
          "full": "3.6.3 (default, Oct  4 2017, 06:09:38) \n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.37)]"
        },

          "version": "3.23.1",
          "extensions": {
            "json1": null,
            "spatialite": "4.3.0a"
          }
        }
      }
- Renamed ``?_sql_time_limit_ms=`` to ``?_timelimit``, closes `#242 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/242>`_
- New ``?_shape=array`` option + tweaks to ``_shape``, closes `#245 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/245>`_

  * Default is now ``?_shape=arrays`` (renamed from ``lists``)
  * New ``?_shape=array`` returns an array of objects as the root object
  * Changed ``?_shape=object`` to return the object as the root
  * Updated docs

- FTS tables now detected by ``inspect()``, closes `#240 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/240>`_
- New ``?_size=XXX`` querystring parameter for table view, closes `#229 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/229>`_

  Also added documentation for all of the ``_special`` arguments.

  Plus deleted some duplicate logic implementing ``_group_count``.
- If ``max_returned_rows==page_size``, increment ``max_returned_rows`` - fixes `#230 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/230>`_
- New ``hidden: True`` option for table metadata, closes `#239 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/239>`_
- Hide ``idx_*`` tables if spatialite detected, closes `#228 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/228>`_
- Added ``class=rows-and-columns`` to custom query results table
- Added CSS class ``rows-and-columns`` to main table
- ``label_column`` option in ``metadata.json`` - closes `#234 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/234>`_

0.20 (2018-04-20)
-----------------

Mostly new work on the :ref:`plugins` mechanism: plugins can now bundle static assets and custom templates, and ``datasette publish`` has a new ``--install=name-of-plugin`` option.

- Add col-X classes to HTML table on custom query page
- Fixed out-dated template in documentation
- Plugins can now bundle custom templates, `#224 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/224>`_
- Added /-/metadata /-/plugins /-/inspect, `#225 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/225>`_
- Documentation for --install option, refs `#223 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/223>`_
- Datasette publish/package --install option, `#223 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/223>`_
- Fix for plugins in Python 3.5, `#222 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/222>`_
- New plugin hooks: extra_css_urls() and extra_js_urls(), `#214 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/214>`_
- /-/static-plugins/PLUGIN_NAME/ now serves static/ from plugins
- <th> now gets class="col-X" - plus added col-X documentation
- Use to_css_class for table cell column classes

  This ensures that columns with spaces in the name will still
  generate usable CSS class names. Refs `#209 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/209>`_
- Add column name classes to <td>s, make PK bold [Russ Garrett]
- Don't duplicate simple primary keys in the link column [Russ Garrett]

  When there's a simple (single-column) primary key, it looks weird to
  duplicate it in the link column.

  This change removes the second PK column and treats the link column as
  if it were the PK column from a header/sorting perspective.
- Correct escaping for HTML display of row links [Russ Garrett]
- Longer time limit for test_paginate_compound_keys

  It was failing intermittently in Travis - see `#209 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/209>`_
- Use application/octet-stream for downloadable databases
- Updated PyPI classifiers
- Updated PyPI link to pypi.org

0.19 (2018-04-16)
-----------------

This is the first preview of the new Datasette plugins mechanism. Only two
plugin hooks are available so far - for custom SQL functions and custom template
filters. There's plenty more to come - read `the documentation
<https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html>`_ and get involved in
`the tracking ticket <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/14>`_ if you
have feedback on the direction so far.

- Fix for ``_sort_desc=sortable_with_nulls`` test, refs `#216 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/216>`_

- Fixed `#216 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/216>`_ - paginate correctly when sorting by nullable column

- Initial documentation for plugins, closes `#213 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/213>`_

  https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html

- New ``--plugins-dir=plugins/`` option (`#212 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/212>`_)

  New option causing Datasette to load and evaluate all of the Python files in
  the specified directory and register any plugins that are defined in those
  files.

  This new option is available for the following commands::

      datasette serve mydb.db --plugins-dir=plugins/
      datasette publish now/heroku mydb.db --plugins-dir=plugins/
      datasette package mydb.db --plugins-dir=plugins/

- Start of the plugin system, based on pluggy (`#210 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/14>`_)

  Uses https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/ originally created for the py.test project

  We're starting with two plugin hooks:

  ``prepare_connection(conn)``

  This is called when a new SQLite connection is created. It can be used to register custom SQL functions.

  ``prepare_jinja2_environment(env)``

  This is called with the Jinja2 environment. It can be used to register custom template tags and filters.

  An example plugin which uses these two hooks can be found at https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-demos or installed using ``pip install datasette-plugin-demos``

  Refs `#14 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/14>`_

- Return HTTP 405 on InvalidUsage rather than 500. [Russ Garrett]

  This also stops it filling up the logs. This happens for HEAD requests
  at the moment - which perhaps should be handled better, but that's a
  different issue.


0.18 (2018-04-14)
-----------------

This release introduces `support for units <http://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metadata.html#specifying-units-for-a-column>`_,
contributed by Russ Garrett (`#203 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/203>`_).
You can now optionally specify the units for specific columns using ``metadata.json``.
Once specified, units will be displayed in the HTML view of your table. They also become
available for use in filters - if a column is configured with a unit of distance, you can
request all rows where that column is less than 50 meters or more than 20 feet for example.

- Link foreign keys which don't have labels. [Russ Garrett]

  This renders unlabeled FKs as simple links.

  Also includes bonus fixes for two minor issues:

  * In foreign key link hrefs the primary key was escaped using HTML
    escaping rather than URL escaping. This broke some non-integer PKs.
  * Print tracebacks to console when handling 500 errors.

- Fix SQLite error when loading rows with no incoming FKs. [Russ
  Garrett]

  This fixes ``ERROR: conn=<sqlite3.Connection object at 0x10bbb9f10>, sql
  = 'select ', params = {'id': '1'}`` caused by an invalid query when
  loading incoming FKs.

  The error was ignored due to async but it still got printed to the
  console.

- Allow custom units to be registered with Pint. [Russ Garrett]
- Support units in filters. [Russ Garrett]
- Tidy up units support. [Russ Garrett]

  * Add units to exported JSON
  * Units key in metadata skeleton
  * Docs

- Initial units support. [Russ Garrett]

  Add support for specifying units for a column in ``metadata.json`` and
  rendering them on display using
  `pint <https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_


0.17 (2018-04-13)
-----------------
- Release 0.17 to fix issues with PyPI


0.16 (2018-04-13)
-----------------
- Better mechanism for handling errors; 404s for missing table/database

  New error mechanism closes `#193 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/193>`_

  404s for missing tables/databases closes `#184 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/184>`_

- long_description in markdown for the new PyPI
- Hide Spatialite system tables. [Russ Garrett]
- Allow ``explain select`` / ``explain query plan select`` `#201 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/201>`_
- Datasette inspect now finds primary_keys `#195 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/195>`_
- Ability to sort using form fields (for mobile portrait mode) `#199 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/199>`_

  We now display sort options as a select box plus a descending checkbox, which
  means you can apply sort orders even in portrait mode on a mobile phone where
  the column headers are hidden.

0.15 (2018-04-09)
-----------------

The biggest new feature in this release is the ability to sort by column. On the
table page the column headers can now be clicked to apply sort (or descending
sort), or you can specify ``?_sort=column`` or ``?_sort_desc=column`` directly
in the URL.

- ``table_rows`` => ``table_rows_count``, ``filtered_table_rows`` =>
  ``filtered_table_rows_count``

  Renamed properties. Closes `#194 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/194>`_

- New ``sortable_columns`` option in ``metadata.json`` to control sort options.

  You can now explicitly set which columns in a table can be used for sorting
  using the ``_sort`` and ``_sort_desc`` arguments using ``metadata.json``::

      {
          "databases": {
              "database1": {
                  "tables": {
                      "example_table": {
                          "sortable_columns": [
                              "height",
                              "weight"
                          ]
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }

  Refs `#189 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/189>`_

- Column headers now link to sort/desc sort - refs `#189 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/189>`_

- ``_sort`` and ``_sort_desc`` parameters for table views

  Allows for paginated sorted results based on a specified column.

  Refs `#189 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/189>`_

- Total row count now correct even if ``_next`` applied

- Use .custom_sql() for _group_count implementation (refs `#150 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/150>`_)

- Make HTML title more readable in query template (`#180 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/180>`_) [Ryan Pitts]

- New ``?_shape=objects/object/lists`` param for JSON API (`#192 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/192>`_)

  New ``_shape=`` parameter replacing old ``.jsono`` extension

  Now instead of this::

      /database/table.jsono

  We use the ``_shape`` parameter like this::

      /database/table.json?_shape=objects

  Also introduced a new ``_shape`` called ``object`` which looks like this::

      /database/table.json?_shape=object

  Returning an object for the rows key::

      ...
      "rows": {
          "pk1": {
              ...
          },
          "pk2": {
              ...
          }
      }

  Refs `#122 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/122>`_

- Utility for writing test database fixtures to a .db file

  ``python tests/fixtures.py /tmp/hello.db``

  This is useful for making a SQLite database of the test fixtures for
  interactive exploration.

- Compound primary key ``_next=`` now plays well with extra filters

  Closes `#190 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/190>`_

- Fixed bug with keyset pagination over compound primary keys

  Refs `#190 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/190>`_

- Database/Table views inherit ``source/license/source_url/license_url``
  metadata

  If you set the ``source_url/license_url/source/license`` fields in your root
  metadata those values will now be inherited all the way down to the database
  and table templates.

  The ``title/description`` are NOT inherited.

  Also added unit tests for the HTML generated by the metadata.

  Refs `#185 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/185>`_

- Add metadata, if it exists, to heroku temp dir (`#178 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/178>`_) [Tony Hirst]
- Initial documentation for pagination
- Broke up test_app into test_api and test_html
- Fixed bug with .json path regular expression

  I had a table called ``geojson`` and it caused an exception because the regex
  was matching ``.json`` and not ``\.json``

- Deploy to Heroku with Python 3.6.3

0.14 (2017-12-09)
-----------------

The theme of this release is customization: Datasette now allows every aspect
of its presentation `to be customized <http://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/custom_templates.html>`_
either using additional CSS or by providing entirely new templates.

Datasette's `metadata.json format <http://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metadata.html>`_
has also been expanded, to allow per-database and per-table metadata. A new
``datasette skeleton`` command can be used to generate a skeleton JSON file
ready to be filled in with per-database and per-table details.

The ``metadata.json`` file can also be used to define
`canned queries <http://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sql_queries.html#canned-queries>`_,
as a more powerful alternative to SQL views.

- ``extra_css_urls``/``extra_js_urls`` in metadata

  A mechanism in the ``metadata.json`` format for adding custom CSS and JS urls.

  Create a ``metadata.json`` file that looks like this::

      {
          "extra_css_urls": [
              "https://simonwillison.net/static/css/all.bf8cd891642c.css"
          ],
          "extra_js_urls": [
              "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js"
          ]
      }

  Then start datasette like this::

      datasette mydb.db --metadata=metadata.json

  The CSS and JavaScript files will be linked in the ``<head>`` of every page.

  You can also specify a SRI (subresource integrity hash) for these assets::

      {
          "extra_css_urls": [
              {
                  "url": "https://simonwillison.net/static/css/all.bf8cd891642c.css",
                  "sri": "sha384-9qIZekWUyjCyDIf2YK1FRoKiPJq4PHt6tp/ulnuuyRBvazd0hG7pWbE99zvwSznI"
              }
          ],
          "extra_js_urls": [
              {
                  "url": "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js",
                  "sri": "sha256-k2WSCIexGzOj3Euiig+TlR8gA0EmPjuc79OEeY5L45g="
              }
          ]
      }

  Modern browsers will only execute the stylesheet or JavaScript if the SRI hash
  matches the content served. You can generate hashes using https://www.srihash.org/

- Auto-link column values that look like URLs (`#153 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/153>`_)

- CSS styling hooks as classes on the body (`#153 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/153>`_)

  Every template now gets CSS classes in the body designed to support custom
  styling.

  The index template (the top level page at ``/``) gets this::

      <body class="index">

  The database template (``/dbname/``) gets this::

      <body class="db db-dbname">

  The table template (``/dbname/tablename``) gets::

      <body class="table db-dbname table-tablename">

  The row template (``/dbname/tablename/rowid``) gets::

      <body class="row db-dbname table-tablename">

  The ``db-x`` and ``table-x`` classes use the database or table names themselves IF
  they are valid CSS identifiers. If they aren't, we strip any invalid
  characters out and append a 6 character md5 digest of the original name, in
  order to ensure that multiple tables which resolve to the same stripped
  character version still have different CSS classes.

  Some examples (extracted from the unit tests)::

      "simple" => "simple"
      "MixedCase" => "MixedCase"
      "-no-leading-hyphens" => "no-leading-hyphens-65bea6"
      "_no-leading-underscores" => "no-leading-underscores-b921bc"
      "no spaces" => "no-spaces-7088d7"
      "-" => "336d5e"
      "no $ characters" => "no--characters-59e024"

- ``datasette --template-dir=mytemplates/`` argument

  You can now pass an additional argument specifying a directory to look for
  custom templates in.

  Datasette will fall back on the default templates if a template is not
  found in that directory.

- Ability to over-ride templates for individual tables/databases.

  It is now possible to over-ride templates on a per-database / per-row or per-
  table basis.

  When you access e.g. ``/mydatabase/mytable`` Datasette will look for the following::

      - table-mydatabase-mytable.html
      - table.html

  If you provided a ``--template-dir`` argument to datasette serve it will look in
  that directory first.

  The lookup rules are as follows::

      Index page (/):
          index.html

      Database page (/mydatabase):
          database-mydatabase.html
          database.html

      Table page (/mydatabase/mytable):
          table-mydatabase-mytable.html
          table.html

      Row page (/mydatabase/mytable/id):
          row-mydatabase-mytable.html
          row.html

  If a table name has spaces or other unexpected characters in it, the template
  filename will follow the same rules as our custom ``<body>`` CSS classes
  - for example, a table called "Food Trucks"
  will attempt to load the following templates::

      table-mydatabase-Food-Trucks-399138.html
      table.html

  It is possible to extend the default templates using Jinja template
  inheritance. If you want to customize EVERY row template with some additional
  content you can do so by creating a row.html template like this::

      {% extends "default:row.html" %}

      {% block content %}
      <h1>EXTRA HTML AT THE TOP OF THE CONTENT BLOCK</h1>
      <p>This line renders the original block:</p>
      {{ super() }}
      {% endblock %}

- ``--static`` option for datasette serve (`#160 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/160>`_)

  You can now tell Datasette to serve static files from a specific location at a
  specific mountpoint.

  For example::

    datasette serve mydb.db --static extra-css:/tmp/static/css

  Now if you visit this URL::

    http://localhost:8001/extra-css/blah.css

  The following file will be served::

    /tmp/static/css/blah.css

- Canned query support.

  Named canned queries can now be defined in ``metadata.json`` like this::

      {
          "databases": {
              "timezones": {
                  "queries": {
                      "timezone_for_point": "select tzid from timezones ..."
                  }
              }
          }
      }

  These will be shown in a new "Queries" section beneath "Views" on the database page.

- New ``datasette skeleton`` command for generating ``metadata.json`` (`#164 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/164>`_)

- ``metadata.json`` support for per-table/per-database metadata (`#165 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/165>`_)

  Also added support for descriptions and HTML descriptions.

  Here's an example metadata.json file illustrating custom per-database and per-
  table metadata::

      {
          "title": "Overall datasette title",
          "description_html": "This is a <em>description with HTML</em>.",
          "databases": {
              "db1": {
                  "title": "First database",
                  "description": "This is a string description & has no HTML",
                  "license_url": "http://example.com/",
              "license": "The example license",
                  "queries": {
                    "canned_query": "select * from table1 limit 3;"
                  },
                  "tables": {
                      "table1": {
                          "title": "Custom title for table1",
                          "description": "Tables can have descriptions too",
                          "source": "This has a custom source",
                          "source_url": "http://example.com/"
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }

- Renamed ``datasette build`` command to ``datasette inspect`` (`#130 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/130>`_)

- Upgrade to Sanic 0.7.0 (`#168 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/168>`_)

  https://github.com/channelcat/sanic/releases/tag/0.7.0

- Package and publish commands now accept ``--static`` and ``--template-dir``

  Example usage::

      datasette package --static css:extra-css/ --static js:extra-js/ \
        sf-trees.db --template-dir templates/ --tag sf-trees --branch master

  This creates a local Docker image that includes copies of the templates/,
  extra-css/ and extra-js/ directories. You can then run it like this::

    docker run -p 8001:8001 sf-trees

  For publishing to Zeit now::

    datasette publish now --static css:extra-css/ --static js:extra-js/ \
      sf-trees.db --template-dir templates/ --name sf-trees --branch master

- HTML comment showing which templates were considered for a page (`#171 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/171>`_)

0.13 (2017-11-24)
-----------------
- Search now applies to current filters.

  Combined search into the same form as filters.

  Closes `#133`_

- Much tidier design for table view header.

  Closes `#147`_

- Added ``?column__not=blah`` filter.

  Closes `#148`_

- Row page now resolves foreign keys.

  Closes `#132`_

- Further tweaks to select/input filter styling.

  Refs `#86`_ - thanks for the help, @natbat!

- Show linked foreign key in table cells.

- Added UI for editing table filters.

  Refs `#86`_

- Hide FTS-created tables on index pages.

  Closes `#129`_

- Add publish to heroku support [Jacob Kaplan-Moss]

  ``datasette publish heroku mydb.db``

  Pull request `#104`_

- Initial implementation of ``?_group_count=column``.

  URL shortcut for counting rows grouped by one or more columns.

  ``?_group_count=column1&_group_count=column2`` works as well.

  SQL generated looks like this::

      select "qSpecies", count(*) as "count"
      from Street_Tree_List
      group by "qSpecies"
      order by "count" desc limit 100

  Or for two columns like this::

      select "qSpecies", "qSiteInfo", count(*) as "count"
      from Street_Tree_List
      group by "qSpecies", "qSiteInfo"
      order by "count" desc limit 100

  Refs `#44`_

- Added ``--build=master`` option to datasette publish and package.

  The ``datasette publish`` and ``datasette package`` commands both now accept an
  optional ``--build`` argument. If provided, this can be used to specify a branch
  published to GitHub that should be built into the container.

  This makes it easier to test code that has not yet been officially released to
  PyPI, e.g.::

      datasette publish now mydb.db --branch=master

- Implemented ``?_search=XXX`` + UI if a FTS table is detected.

  Closes `#131`_

- Added ``datasette --version`` support.

- Table views now show expanded foreign key references, if possible.

  If a table has foreign key columns, and those foreign key tables have
  ``label_columns``, the TableView will now query those other tables for the
  corresponding values and display those values as links in the corresponding
  table cells.

  label_columns are currently detected by the ``inspect()`` function, which looks
  for any table that has just two columns - an ID column and one other - and
  sets the ``label_column`` to be that second non-ID column.

- Don't prevent tabbing to "Run SQL" button (`#117`_) [Robert Gieseke]

  See comment in `#115`_

- Add keyboard shortcut to execute SQL query (`#115`_) [Robert Gieseke]

- Allow ``--load-extension`` to be set via environment variable.

- Add support for ``?field__isnull=1`` (`#107`_) [Ray N]

- Add spatialite, switch to debian and local build (`#114`_) [Ariel Núñez]

- Added ``--load-extension`` argument to datasette serve.

  Allows loading of SQLite extensions. Refs `#110`_.

0.12 (2017-11-16)
-----------------
- Added ``__version__``, now displayed as tooltip in page footer (`#108`_).
- Added initial docs, including a changelog (`#99`_).
- Turned on auto-escaping in Jinja.
- Added a UI for editing named parameters (`#96`_).

  You can now construct a custom SQL statement using SQLite named
  parameters (e.g. ``:name``) and datasette will display form fields for
  editing those parameters. `Here’s an example`_ which lets you see the
  most popular names for dogs of different species registered through
  various dog registration schemes in Australia.

.. _Here’s an example: https://australian-dogs.now.sh/australian-dogs-3ba9628?sql=select+name%2C+count%28*%29+as+n+from+%28%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22Animal+name%22%29+as+name+from+%5BAdelaide-City-Council-dog-registrations-2013%5D+where+Breed+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28Animal_Name%29+as+name+from+%5BAdelaide-City-Council-dog-registrations-2014%5D+where+Breed_Description+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all+%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28Animal_Name%29+as+name+from+%5BAdelaide-City-Council-dog-registrations-2015%5D+where+Breed_Description+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22AnimalName%22%29+as+name+from+%5BCity-of-Port-Adelaide-Enfield-Dog_Registrations_2016%5D+where+AnimalBreed+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22Animal+Name%22%29+as+name+from+%5BMitcham-dog-registrations-2015%5D+where+Breed+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22DOG_NAME%22%29+as+name+from+%5Bburnside-dog-registrations-2015%5D+where+DOG_BREED+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all+%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22Animal_Name%22%29+as+name+from+%5Bcity-of-playford-2015-dog-registration%5D+where+Breed_Description+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22Animal+Name%22%29+as+name+from+%5Bcity-of-prospect-dog-registration-details-2016%5D+where%22Breed+Description%22+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0A%29+group+by+name+order+by+n+desc%3B&breed=pug

- Pin to specific Jinja version. (`#100`_).
- Default to 127.0.0.1 not 0.0.0.0. (`#98`_).
- Added extra metadata options to publish and package commands. (`#92`_).

  You can now run these commands like so::

      datasette now publish mydb.db \
          --title="My Title" \
          --source="Source" \
          --source_url="http://www.example.com/" \
          --license="CC0" \
          --license_url="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"

  This will write those values into the metadata.json that is packaged with the
  app. If you also pass ``--metadata=metadata.json`` that file will be updated with the extra
  values before being written into the Docker image.
- Added simple production-ready Dockerfile (`#94`_) [Andrew
  Cutler]
- New ``?_sql_time_limit_ms=10`` argument to database and table page (`#95`_)
- SQL syntax highlighting with Codemirror (`#89`_) [Tom Dyson]

0.11 (2017-11-14)
-----------------
- Added ``datasette publish now --force`` option.

  This calls ``now`` with ``--force`` - useful as it means you get a fresh copy of datasette even if Now has already cached that docker layer.
- Enable ``--cors`` by default when running in a container.

0.10 (2017-11-14)
-----------------
- Fixed `#83`_ - 500 error on individual row pages.
- Stop using sqlite WITH RECURSIVE in our tests.

  The version of Python 3 running in Travis CI doesn't support this.

.. _#83: https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/83

0.9 (2017-11-13)
----------------
- Added ``--sql_time_limit_ms`` and ``--extra-options``.

  The serve command now accepts ``--sql_time_limit_ms`` for customizing the SQL time
  limit.

  The publish and package commands now accept ``--extra-options`` which can be used
  to specify additional options to be passed to the datasite serve command when
  it executes inside the resulting Docker containers.

0.8 (2017-11-13)
----------------
- V0.8 - added PyPI metadata, ready to ship.
- Implemented offset/limit pagination for views (`#70`_).
- Improved pagination. (`#78`_)
- Limit on max rows returned, controlled by ``--max_returned_rows`` option. (`#69`_)

  If someone executes 'select * from table' against a table with a million rows
  in it, we could run into problems: just serializing that much data as JSON is
  likely to lock up the server.

  Solution: we now have a hard limit on the maximum number of rows that can be
  returned by a query. If that limit is exceeded, the server will return a
  ``"truncated": true`` field in the JSON.

  This limit can be optionally controlled by the new ``--max_returned_rows``
  option. Setting that option to 0 disables the limit entirely.

.. _config:

Configuration
=============

Datasette provides a number of configuration options. These can be set using the ``--config name:value`` option to ``datasette serve``.

You can set multiple configuration options at once like this::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config default_page_size:50 \
        --config sql_time_limit_ms:3500 \
        --config max_returned_rows:2000

To prevent rogue, long-running queries from making a Datasette instance inaccessible to other users, Datasette imposes some limits on the SQL that you can execute. These are exposed as config options which you can over-ride.

default_page_size
-----------------

The default number of rows returned by the table page. You can over-ride this on a per-page basis using the ``?_size=80`` querystring parameter, provided you do not specify a value higher than the ``max_returned_rows`` setting. You can set this default using ``--config`` like so::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config default_page_size:50

sql_time_limit_ms
-----------------

By default, queries have a time limit of one second. If a query takes longer than this to run Datasette will terminate the query and return an error.

If this time limit is too short for you, you can customize it using the ``sql_time_limit_ms`` limit - for example, to increase it to 3.5 seconds::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config sql_time_limit_ms:3500

You can optionally set a lower time limit for an individual query using the ``?_timelimit=100`` querystring argument::

    /my-database/my-table?qSpecies=44&_timelimit=100

This would set the time limit to 100ms for that specific query. This feature is useful if you are working with databases of unknown size and complexity - a query that might make perfect sense for a smaller table could take too long to execute on a table with millions of rows. By setting custom time limits you can execute queries "optimistically" - e.g. give me an exact count of rows matching this query but only if it takes less than 100ms to calculate.

.. _config_max_returned_rows:

max_returned_rows
-----------------

Datasette returns a maximum of 1,000 rows of data at a time. If you execute a query that returns more than 1,000 rows, Datasette will return the first 1,000 and include a warning that the result set has been truncated. You can use OFFSET/LIMIT or other methods in your SQL to implement pagination if you need to return more than 1,000 rows.

You can increase or decrease this limit like so::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config max_returned_rows:2000

num_sql_threads
---------------

Maximum number of threads in the thread pool Datasette uses to execute SQLite queries. Defaults to 3.

::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config num_sql_threads:10

allow_facet
-----------

Allow users to specify columns they would like to facet on using the ``?_facet=COLNAME`` URL parameter to the table view.

This is enabled by default. If disabled, facets will still be displayed if they have been specifically enabled in ``metadata.json`` configuration for the table.

Here's how to disable this feature::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config allow_facet:off

default_facet_size
------------------

The default number of unique rows returned by :ref:`facets` is 30. You can customize it like this::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config default_facet_size:50

facet_time_limit_ms
-------------------

This is the time limit Datasette allows for calculating a facet, which defaults to 200ms::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config facet_time_limit_ms:1000

facet_suggest_time_limit_ms
---------------------------

When Datasette calculates suggested facets it needs to run a SQL query for every column in your table. The default for this time limit is 50ms to account for the fact that it needs to run once for every column. If the time limit is exceeded the column will not be suggested as a facet.

You can increase this time limit like so::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config facet_suggest_time_limit_ms:500

suggest_facets
--------------

Should Datasette calculate suggested facets? On by default, turn this off like so::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config suggest_facets:off

allow_download
--------------

Should users be able to download the original SQLite database using a link on the database index page? This is turned on by default - to disable database downloads, use the following::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config allow_download:off

.. _config_allow_sql:

allow_sql
---------

Enable/disable the ability for users to run custom SQL directly against a database. To disable this feature, run::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config allow_sql:off

.. _config_default_cache_ttl:

default_cache_ttl
-----------------

Default HTTP caching max-age header in seconds, used for ``Cache-Control: max-age=X``. Can be over-ridden on a per-request basis using the ``?_ttl=`` querystring parameter. Set this to ``0`` to disable HTTP caching entirely. Defaults to 5 seconds.

::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config default_cache_ttl:60

.. _config_default_cache_ttl_hashed:

default_cache_ttl_hashed
------------------------

Default HTTP caching max-age for responses served using using the :ref:`hashed-urls mechanism <config_hash_urls>`. Defaults to 365 days (31536000 seconds).

::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config default_cache_ttl_hashed:10000


cache_size_kb
-------------

Sets the amount of memory SQLite uses for its `per-connection cache <https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size>`_, in KB.

::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config cache_size_kb:5000

.. _config_allow_csv_stream:

allow_csv_stream
----------------

Enables :ref:`the CSV export feature <csv_export>` where an entire table
(potentially hundreds of thousands of rows) can be exported as a single CSV
file. This is turned on by default - you can turn it off like this:

::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config allow_csv_stream:off

.. _config_max_csv_mb:

max_csv_mb
----------

The maximum size of CSV that can be exported, in megabytes. Defaults to 100MB.
You can disable the limit entirely by settings this to 0:

::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config max_csv_mb:0

.. _config_truncate_cells_html:

truncate_cells_html
-------------------

In the HTML table view, truncate any strings that are longer than this value.
The full value will still be available in CSV, JSON and on the individual row
HTML page. Set this to 0 to disable truncation.

::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config truncate_cells_html:0


force_https_urls
----------------

Forces self-referential URLs in the JSON output to always use the ``https://``
protocol. This is useful for cases where the application itself is hosted using
HTTP but is served to the outside world via a proxy that enables HTTPS.

::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config force_https_urls:1

.. _config_hash_urls:

hash_urls
---------

When enabled, this setting causes Datasette to append a content hash of the
database file to the URL path for every table and query within that database.

When combined with far-future expire headers this ensures that queries can be
cached forever, safe in the knowledge that any modifications to the database
itself will result in new, uncachcacheed URL paths.

::

    datasette mydatabase.db --config hash_urls:1

.. _contributing:

Contributing
============

Datasette is an open source project. We welcome contributions!

This document describes how to contribute to Datasette core. You can also contribute to the wider Datasette ecosystem by creating new :ref:`plugins`.

General guidelines
------------------

* **master should always be releasable**. Incomplete features should live in branches. This ensures that any small bug fixes can be quickly released.
* **The ideal commit** should bundle together the implementation, unit tests and associated documentation updates. The commit message should link to an associated issue.

.. _devenvironment:

Setting up a development environment
------------------------------------

If you have Python 3.5 or higher installed on your computer (on OS X the easiest way to do this `is using homebrew <https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/>`__) you can install an editable copy of Datasette using the following steps.

If you want to use GitHub to publish your changes, first `create a fork of datasette <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/fork>`__ under your own GitHub account.

Now clone that repository somewhere on your computer::

    git clone git@github.com:YOURNAME/datasette

If you just want to get started without creating your own fork, you can do this instead::

    git clone git@github.com:simonw/datasette

The next step is to create a virtual environment for your project and use it to install Datasette's dependencies::

    cd datasette
    # Create a virtual environment in ./venv
    python3 -m venv ./venv
    # Now activate the virtual environment, so pip can install into it
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Install Datasette and its testing dependencies
    python3 -m pip install -e .[test]

That last line does most of the work: ``pip install -e`` means "install this package in a way that allows me to edit the source code in place". The ``.[test]`` option means "use the setup.py in this directory and install the optional testing dependencies as well".

Once you have done this, you can run the Datasette unit tests from inside your ``datasette/`` directory using `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`__ like so::

    pytest

To run Datasette itself, just type ``datasette``.

You're going to need at least one SQLite database. An easy way to get started is to use the fixtures database that Datasette uses for its own tests.

You can create a copy of that database by running this command::

    python tests/fixtures.py fixtures.db

Now you can run Datasette against the new fixtures database like so::

    datasette fixtures.db

This will start a server at ``http://127.0.0.1:8001/``.

Any changes you make in the ``datasette/templates`` or ``datasette/static`` folder will be picked up immediately (though you may need to do a force-refresh in your browser to see changes to CSS or JavaScript).

If you want to change Datasette's Python code you can use the ``--reload`` option to cause Datasette to automatically reload any time the underlying code changes::

    datasette --reload fixtures.db

You can also use the ``fixtures.py`` script to recreate the testing version of ``metadata.json`` used by the unit tests. To do that::

    python tests/fixtures.py fixtures.db fixtures-metadata.json

(You may need to delete ``fixtures.db`` before running this command.)

Then run Datasette like this::

    datasette fixtures.db -m fixtures-metadata.json

.. _contributing_documentation:

Editing and building the documentation
--------------------------------------

Datasette's documentation lives in the ``docs/`` directory and is deployed automatically using `Read The Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`__.

The documentation is written using reStructuredText. You may find this article on `The subset of reStructuredText worth committing to memory <https://simonwillison.net/2018/Aug/25/restructuredtext/>`__ useful.

You can build it locally by installing ``sphinx`` and ``sphinx_rtd_theme`` in your Datasette development environment and then running ``make html`` directly in the ``docs/`` directory::

    # You may first need to activate your virtual environment:
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Install the dependencies needed to build the docs
    pip install -e .[docs]

    # Now build the docs
    cd docs/
    make html

This will create the HTML version of the documentation in ``docs/_build/html``. You can open it in your browser like so::

    open _build/html/index.html

Any time you make changes to a ``.rst`` file you can re-run ``make html`` to update the built documents, then refresh them in your browser.

For added productivity, you can use use `sphinx-autobuild <https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autobuild/>`__ to run Sphinx in auto-build mode. This will run a local webserver serving the docs that automatically rebuilds them and refreshes the page any time you hit save in your editor.

``sphinx-autobuild`` will have been installed when you ran ``pip install -e .[docs]``. In your ``docs/`` directory you can start the server by running the following::

    make livehtml

Now browse to ``http://localhost:8000/`` to view the documentation. Any edits you make should be instantly reflected in your browser.

.. _contributing_release:

Release process
---------------

Datasette releases are performed using tags. When a new version tag is pushed to GitHub, a `Travis CI task <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/master/.travis.yml>`__ will perform the following:

* Run the unit tests against all supported Python versions. If the tests pass...
* Set up https://v0-25-1.datasette.io/ (but with the new tag) to point to a live demo of this release
* Build a Docker image of the release and push a tag to https://hub.docker.com/r/datasetteproject/datasette
* Re-point the "latest" tag on Docker Hub to the new image
* Build a wheel bundle of the underlying Python source code
* Push that new wheel up to PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/datasette/

To deploy new releases you will need to have push access to the main Datasette GitHub repository.

Datasette follows `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`__::

    major.minor.patch

We increment ``major`` for backwards-incompatible releases. Datasette is currently pre-1.0 so the major version is always ``0``.

We increment ``minor`` for new features.

We increment ``patch`` for bugfix releass.

To release a new version, first create a commit that updates :ref:`the changelog <changelog>` with highlights of the new version. An example `commit can be seen here <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/28872a1fa789f314b0342f4e6182f1c78d6e2bca>`__::

    # Update changelog
    git commit -m "Release 0.25.2" -a
    git push

For non-bugfix releases you may want to update the news section of ``README.md`` as part of the same commit.

Wait long enough for Travis to build and deploy the demo version of that commit (otherwise the tag deployment may fail to alias to it properly). Then run the following::

    git tag 0.25.2
    git push --tags

Once the release is out, you can manually update https://github.com/simonw/datasette/releases

.. _csv_export:

CSV Export
==========

Any Datasette table, view or custom SQL query can be exported as CSV.

To obtain the CSV representation of the table you are looking, click the "this
data as CSV" link.

You can also use the advanced export form for more control over the resulting
file, which looks like this and has the following options:

.. image:: advanced_export.png

* **download file** - instead of displaying CSV in your browser, this forces
  your browser to download the CSV to your downloads directory.

* **expand labels** - if your table has any foreign key references this option
  will cause the CSV to gain additional ``COLUMN_NAME_label`` columns with a
  label for each foreign key derived from the linked table. `In this example
  <https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable.csv?_labels=on&_size=max>`_
  the ``city_id`` column is accompanied by a ``city_id_label`` column.

* **stream all rows** - by default CSV files only contain the first
  :ref:`config_max_returned_rows` records. This option will cause Datasette to
  loop through every matching record and return them as a single CSV file.

You can try that out on https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable?_size=4

Streaming all records
---------------------

The *stream all rows* option is designed to be as efficient as possible -
under the hood it takes advantage of Python 3 asyncio capabilities and
Datasette's efficient :ref:`pagination <pagination>` to stream back the full
CSV file.

Since databases can get pretty large, by default this option is capped at 100MB -
if a table returns more than 100MB of data the last line of the CSV will be a
truncation error message.

You can increase or remove this limit using the :ref:`config_max_csv_mb` config
setting. You can also disable the CSV export feature entirely using
:ref:`config_allow_csv_stream`.

A note on URLs
--------------

The default URL for the CSV representation of a table is that table with
``.csv`` appended to it:

* https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable - HTML interface
* https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable.csv - CSV export
* https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable.json - JSON API

This pattern doesn't work for tables with names that already end in ``.csv`` or
``.json``. For those tables, you can instead use the ``_format=`` querystring
parameter:

* https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/table%2Fwith%2Fslashes.csv - HTML interface
* https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/table%2Fwith%2Fslashes.csv?_format=csv - CSV export
* https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/table%2Fwith%2Fslashes.csv?_format=json - JSON API

.. _customization:

Customization
=============

Datasette provides a number of ways of customizing the way data is displayed.

Custom CSS and JavaScript
-------------------------

When you launch Datasette, you can specify a custom metadata file like this::

    datasette mydb.db --metadata metadata.json

Your ``metadata.json`` file can include links that look like this::

    {
        "extra_css_urls": [
            "https://simonwillison.net/static/css/all.bf8cd891642c.css"
        ],
        "extra_js_urls": [
            "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js"
        ]
    }

The extra CSS and JavaScript files will be linked in the ``<head>`` of every page.

You can also specify a SRI (subresource integrity hash) for these assets::

    {
        "extra_css_urls": [
            {
                "url": "https://simonwillison.net/static/css/all.bf8cd891642c.css",
                "sri": "sha384-9qIZekWUyjCyDIf2YK1FRoKiPJq4PHt6tp/ulnuuyRBvazd0hG7pWbE99zvwSznI"
            }
        ],
        "extra_js_urls": [
            {
                "url": "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js",
                "sri": "sha256-k2WSCIexGzOj3Euiig+TlR8gA0EmPjuc79OEeY5L45g="
            }
        ]
    }

Modern browsers will only execute the stylesheet or JavaScript if the SRI hash
matches the content served. You can generate hashes using `www.srihash.org <https://www.srihash.org/>`_

Every default template includes CSS classes in the body designed to support
custom styling.

The index template (the top level page at ``/``) gets this::

    <body class="index">

The database template (``/dbname``) gets this::

    <body class="db db-dbname">

The custom SQL template (``/dbname?sql=...``) gets this::

    <body class="query db-dbname">

The table template (``/dbname/tablename``) gets::

    <body class="table db-dbname table-tablename">

The row template (``/dbname/tablename/rowid``) gets::

    <body class="row db-dbname table-tablename">

The ``db-x`` and ``table-x`` classes use the database or table names themselves if
they are valid CSS identifiers. If they aren't, we strip any invalid
characters out and append a 6 character md5 digest of the original name, in
order to ensure that multiple tables which resolve to the same stripped
character version still have different CSS classes.

Some examples::

    "simple" => "simple"
    "MixedCase" => "MixedCase"
    "-no-leading-hyphens" => "no-leading-hyphens-65bea6"
    "_no-leading-underscores" => "no-leading-underscores-b921bc"
    "no spaces" => "no-spaces-7088d7"
    "-" => "336d5e"
    "no $ characters" => "no--characters-59e024"

``<td>`` and ``<th>`` elements also get custom CSS classes reflecting the
database column they are representing, for example::

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th class="col-id" scope="col">id</th>
                <th class="col-name" scope="col">name</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td class="col-id"><a href="...">1</a></td>
                <td class="col-name">SMITH</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

.. _customization_custom_templates:

Custom templates
----------------

By default, Datasette uses default templates that ship with the package.

You can over-ride these templates by specifying a custom ``--template-dir`` like
this::

    datasette mydb.db --template-dir=mytemplates/

Datasette will now first look for templates in that directory, and fall back on
the defaults if no matches are found.

It is also possible to over-ride templates on a per-database, per-row or per-
table basis.

The lookup rules Datasette uses are as follows::

    Index page (/):
        index.html

    Database page (/mydatabase):
        database-mydatabase.html
        database.html

    Custom query page (/mydatabase?sql=...):
        query-mydatabase.html
        query.html

    Canned query page (/mydatabase/canned-query):
        query-mydatabase-canned-query.html
        query-mydatabase.html
        query.html

    Table page (/mydatabase/mytable):
        table-mydatabase-mytable.html
        table.html

    Row page (/mydatabase/mytable/id):
        row-mydatabase-mytable.html
        row.html

    Table of rows and columns include on table page:
        _table-table-mydatabase-mytable.html
        _table-mydatabase-mytable.html
        _table.html

    Table of rows and columns include on row page:
        _table-row-mydatabase-mytable.html
        _table-mydatabase-mytable.html
        _table.html

If a table name has spaces or other unexpected characters in it, the template
filename will follow the same rules as our custom ``<body>`` CSS classes - for
example, a table called "Food Trucks" will attempt to load the following
templates::

    table-mydatabase-Food-Trucks-399138.html
    table.html

You can find out which templates were considered for a specific page by viewing
source on that page and looking for an HTML comment at the bottom. The comment
will look something like this::

    <!-- Templates considered: *query-mydb-tz.html, query-mydb.html, query.html -->

This example is from the canned query page for a query called "tz" in the
database called "mydb". The asterisk shows which template was selected - so in
this case, Datasette found a template file called ``query-mydb-tz.html`` and
used that - but if that template had not been found, it would have tried for
``query-mydb.html`` or the default ``query.html``.

It is possible to extend the default templates using Jinja template
inheritance. If you want to customize EVERY row template with some additional
content you can do so by creating a ``row.html`` template like this::

    {% extends "default:row.html" %}

    {% block content %}
    <h1>EXTRA HTML AT THE TOP OF THE CONTENT BLOCK</h1>
    <p>This line renders the original block:</p>
    {{ super() }}
    {% endblock %}

Note the ``default:row.html`` template name, which ensures Jinja will inherit
from the default template.

The ``_table.html`` template is included by both the row and the table pages,
and a list of rows. The default ``_table.html`` template renders them as an
HTML template and `can be seen here <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/master/datasette/templates/_table.html>`_.

You can provide a custom template that applies to all of your databases and
tables, or you can provide custom templates for specific tables using the
template naming scheme described above.

If you want to present your data in a format other than an HTML table, you
can do so by looping through ``display_rows`` in your own ``_table.html``
template. You can use ``{{ row["column_name"] }}`` to output the raw value
of a specific column.

If you want to output the rendered HTML version of a column, including any
links to foreign keys, you can use ``{{ row.display("column_name") }}``.

Here is an example of a custom ``_table.html`` template::

    {% for row in display_rows %}
        <div>
            <h2>{{ row["title"] }}</h2>
            <p>{{ row["description"] }}<lp>
            <p>Category: {{ row.display("category_id") }}</p>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}

.. _ecosystem:

=======================
The Datasette Ecosystem
=======================

Datasette sits at the center of a growing ecosystem of open source tools aimed at making it as easy as possible to gather, analyze and publish interesting data.

These tools are divided into two main groups: tools for building SQLite databases (for use with Datasette) and plugins that extend Datasette's functionality.

Tools for creating SQLite databases
===================================

csvs-to-sqlite
--------------

`csvs-to-sqlite <https://github.com/simonw/csvs-to-sqlite>`__ lets you take one or more CSV files and load them into a SQLite database. It can also extract repeated columns out into a separate table and configure SQLite full-text search against the contents of specific columns.

sqlite-utils
------------

`sqlite-utils <https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils>`__ is a Python library and CLI tool that provides shortcuts for loading data into SQLite. It can be used programmatically (e.g. in a `Jupyter notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`__) to load data, and will automatically create SQLite tables with the necessary schema.

The CLI tool can consume JSON streams directly and use them to create tables. It can also be used to query SQLite databases and output the results as CSV or JSON.

See `sqlite-utils: a Python library and CLI tool for building SQLite databases <https://simonwillison.net/2019/Feb/25/sqlite-utils/>`__ for more.

db-to-sqlite
------------

`db-to-sqlite <https://github.com/simonw/db-to-sqlite>`__ is a CLI tool that builds on top of `SQLAlchemy <https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&q=sqlalchemy>`__ and allows you to connect to any database supported by that library (including MySQL, oracle and PostgreSQL), run a SQL query and save the results to a new table in a SQLite database. 

You can mirror an entire database (including copying foreign key relationships) with the ``--all`` option::

    $ db-to-sqlite --connection="postgresql://simonw@localhost/myblog" --all blog.db

dbf-to-sqlite
-------------

`dbf-to-sqlite <https://github.com/simonw/dbf-to-sqlite>`__ works with `dBase files <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.dbf>`__ such as those produced by Visual FoxPro. It is a command-line tool that can convert one or more ``.dbf`` file to tables in a SQLite database.

markdown-to-sqlite
------------------

`markdown-to-sqlite <https://github.com/simonw/markdown-to-sqlite>`__ reads Markdown files with embedded YAML metadata (e.g. for `Jekyll Front Matter <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/>`__) and creates a SQLite table with a schema matching the metadata. This is useful if you want to keep structured data in text form in a GitHub repository and use that to build a SQLite database.

socrata2sql
-----------

`socrata2sql <https://github.com/DallasMorningNews/socrata2sql>`__ is a tool by Andrew Chavez at the Dallas Morning News. It works with Socrata, a widely used platform for local and national government open data portals. It uses the Socrata API to pull down government datasets and store them in a local SQLite database (it can also export data to PostgreSQL, MySQL and other SQLAlchemy-supported databases).

For example, to create a SQLite database of the `City of Dallas Payment Register <https://www.dallasopendata.com/Budget-Finance/City-of-Dallas-Payment-Register/64pp-jeba>`__ you would run the following command::

    $ socrata2sql insert www.dallasopendata.com 64pp-jeba

Datasette Plugins
=================

Datasette's :ref:`plugin system <plugins>` makes it easy to enhance Datasette with additional functionality.

datasette-cluster-map
---------------------

`datasette-cluster-map <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map>`__ is the original Datasette plugin, described in `Datasette plugins, and building a clustered map visualization <https://simonwillison.net/2018/Apr/20/datasette-plugins/>`__.

The plugin works against any table with latitude and longitude columns. It can load over 100,000 points onto a map to visualize the geographical distribution of the underlying data.

datasette-vega
--------------

`datasette-vega <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-vega>`__ exposes the powerful  `Vega <https://vega.github.io/vega/>`__ charting library, allowing you to construct line, bar and scatter charts against your data and share links to your visualizations.

datasette-auth-github
---------------------

`datasette-auth-github <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-github>`__ adds an authentication layer to Datasette. Users will have to sign in using their GitHub account before they can view data or interact with Datasette. You can also use it to restrict access to specific GitHub users, or to members of specified GitHub `organizations <https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-organizations>`__ or `teams <https://help.github.com/en/articles/organizing-members-into-teams>`__.

datasette-json-html
-------------------

`datasette-json-html <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-json-html>`__ renders HTML in Datasette's table view driven by JSON returned from your SQL queries. This provides a way to embed images, links and lists of links directly in Datasette's main interface, defined using custom SQL statements.

datasette-jellyfish
-------------------

`datasette-jellyfish <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-jellyfish>`__ exposes custom SQL functions for a range of common fuzzy string matching functions, including soundex, porter stemming and levenshtein distance. It builds on top of the `Jellyfish Python library <https://jellyfish.readthedocs.io/>`__.

datasette-doublemetaphone
-------------------------

`datasette-doublemetaphone <https://github.com/dracos/datasette-doublemetaphone>`__ by Matthew Somerville adds custom SQL functions for applying the Double Metaphone fuzzy "sounds like" algorithm.

datasette-jq
------------

`datasette-jq <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-jq>`__ adds a custom SQL function for filtering and transforming values from JSON columns using the `jq <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`__ expression language.

datasette-render-images
-----------------------

`datasette-render-images <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-render-images>`__ works with SQLite tables that contain binary image data in BLOB columns. It converts any images it finds into ``data-uri`` image elements, allowing you to view them directly in the Datasette interface.

datasette-render-binary
-----------------------

`datasette-render-binary <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-render-binary>`__ renders binary data in a slightly more readable fashion: it shows ASCII characters as they are, and shows all other data as monospace octets. Useful as a tool for exploring new unfamiliar databases as it makes it easier to spot if a binary column may contain a decipherable binary format.

datasette-pretty-json
---------------------

`datasette-pretty-json <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-pretty-json>`__ seeks out JSON values in Datasette's table browsing interface and pretty-prints them, making them easier to read.

datasette-sqlite-fts4
---------------------

`datasette-sqlite-fts4 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-sqlite-fts4>`__ provides search relevance ranking algorithms that can be used with SQLite's FTS4 search module. You can read more about it in `Exploring search relevance algorithms with SQLite <https://simonwillison.net/2019/Jan/7/exploring-search-relevance-algorithms-sqlite/>`__.

datasette-bplist
----------------

`datasette-bplist <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-bplist>`__ provides tools for working with Apple's binary plist format embedded in SQLite database tables. If you use OS X you already have dozens of SQLite databases hidden away in your ``~/Library`` folder that include data in this format - this plugin allows you to view the decoded data and run SQL queries against embedded values using a ``bplist_to_json(value)`` custom SQL function.

.. _facets:

Facets
======

Datasette facets can be used to add a faceted browse interface to any database table. With facets, tables are displayed along with a summary showing the most common values in specified columns. These values can be selected to further filter the table.

.. image:: facets.png

Facets can be specified in two ways: using querystring parameters, or in ``metadata.json`` configuration for the table.

Facets in querystrings
----------------------

To turn on faceting for specific columns on a Datasette table view, add one or more ``_facet=COLUMN`` parameters to the URL. For example, if you want to turn on facets for the ``city_id`` and ``state`` columns, construct a URL that looks like this::

    /dbname/tablename?_facet=state&_facet=city_id

This works for both the HTML interface and the ``.json`` view. When enabled, facets will cause a ``facet_results`` block to be added to the JSON output, looking something like this::

    {
      "state": {
        "name": "state",
        "results": [
          {
            "value": "CA",
            "label": "CA",
            "count": 10,
            "toggle_url": "http://...?_facet=city_id&_facet=state&state=CA",
            "selected": false
          },
          {
            "value": "MI",
            "label": "MI",
            "count": 4,
            "toggle_url": "http://...?_facet=city_id&_facet=state&state=MI",
            "selected": false
          },
          {
            "value": "MC",
            "label": "MC",
            "count": 1,
            "toggle_url": "http://...?_facet=city_id&_facet=state&state=MC",
            "selected": false
          }
        ],
        "truncated": false
      }
      "city_id": {
        "name": "city_id",
        "results": [
          {
            "value": 1,
            "label": "San Francisco",
            "count": 6,
            "toggle_url": "http://...?_facet=city_id&_facet=state&city_id=1",
            "selected": false
          },
          {
            "value": 2,
            "label": "Los Angeles",
            "count": 4,
            "toggle_url": "http://...?_facet=city_id&_facet=state&city_id=2",
            "selected": false
          },
          {
            "value": 3,
            "label": "Detroit",
            "count": 4,
            "toggle_url": "http://...?_facet=city_id&_facet=state&city_id=3",
            "selected": false
          },
          {
            "value": 4,
            "label": "Memnonia",
            "count": 1,
            "toggle_url": "http://...?_facet=city_id&_facet=state&city_id=4",
            "selected": false
          }
        ],
        "truncated": false
      }
    }

If Datasette detects that a column is a foreign key, the ``"label"`` property will be automatically derived from the detected label column on the referenced table.

Facets in metadata.json
-----------------------

You can turn facets on by default for specific tables by adding them to a ``"facets"`` key in a Datasette :ref:`metadata` file.

Here's an example that turns on faceting by default for the ``qLegalStatus`` column in the ``Street_Tree_List`` table in the ``sf-trees`` database::

    {
      "databases": {
        "sf-trees": {
          "tables": {
            "Street_Tree_List": {
              "facets": ["qLegalStatus"]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

Facets defined in this way will always be shown in the interface and returned in the API, regardless of the ``_facet`` arguments passed to the view.

Suggested facets
----------------

Datasette's table UI will suggest facets for the user to apply, based on the following criteria:

For the currently filtered data are there any columns which, if applied as a facet...

* Will return 30 or less unique options
* Will return more than one unique option
* Will return less unique options than the total number of filtered rows
* And the query used to evaluate this criteria can be completed in under 50ms

That last point is particularly important: Datasette runs a query for every column that is displayed on a page, which could get expensive - so to avoid slow load times it sets a time limit of just 50ms for each of those queries. This means suggested facets are unlikely to appear for tables with millions of records in them.

Speeding up facets with indexes
-------------------------------

The performance of facets can be greatly improved by adding indexes on the columns you wish to facet by. Adding indexes can be performed using the ``sqlite3`` command-line utility. Here's how to add an index on the ``state`` column in a table called ``Food_Trucks``::

    $ sqlite3 mydatabase.db
    SQLite version 3.19.3 2017-06-27 16:48:08
    Enter ".help" for usage hints.
    sqlite> CREATE INDEX Food_Trucks_state ON Food_Trucks("state");

.. _facet_by_json_array:

Facet by JSON array
-------------------

If your SQLite installation provides the ``json1`` extension (you can check using :ref:`JsonDataView_versions`) Datasette will automatically detect columns that contain JSON arrays of values and offer a faceting interface against those columns.

This is useful for modelling things like tags without needing to break them out into a new table.

Example here: `latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable?_facet_array=tags <https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable?_facet_array=tags>`__

.. _facet_by_date:

Facet by date
-------------

If Datasette finds any columns that contain dates in the first 100 values, it will offer a faceting interface against the dates of those values. This works especially well against timestamp values such as ``2019-03-01 12:44:00``.

Example here: `latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable?_facet_date=created <https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable?_facet_date=created>`__

.. _full_text_search:

Full-text search
================

SQLite includes `a powerful mechanism for enabling full-text search <https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html>`_ against SQLite records. Datasette can detect if a table has had full-text search configured for it in the underlying database and       display a search interface for filtering that table.

.. image:: full_text_search.png

Datasette automatically detects which tables have been configured for full-text search.

FTS versions
------------

There are three different versions of the SQLite FTS module: FTS3, FTS4 and FTS5. You can tell which versions are supported by your instance of Datasette by checking the ``/-/versions`` page.

FTS5 is the most advanced module but may not be available in the SQLite version that is bundled with your Python installation. Most importantly, FTS5 is the only version that has the ability to order by search relevance without needing extra code.

If you can't be sure that FTS5 will be available, you should use FTS4.

Adding full-text search to a SQLite table
-----------------------------------------

Datasette takes advantage of the `external content <https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#_external_content_fts4_tables_>`_ mechanism in SQLite, which allows a full-text search virtual table to be associated with the contents of another SQLite table.

To set up full-text search for a table, you need to do two things:

* Create a new FTS virtual table associated with your table
* Populate that FTS table with the data that you would like to be able to run searches against

Configuring FTS using sqlite-utils
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`sqlite-utils <https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/>`__ is a CLI utility and Python library for manipulating SQLite databases. You can use `it from Python code <https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python-api.html#enabling-full-text-search>`__ to configure FTS search, or you can achieve the same goal `using the accompanying command-line tool <https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#configuring-full-text-search>`__.

Here's how to use ``sqlite-utils`` to enable full-text search for an ``items`` table across the ``name`` and ``description`` columns::

    $ sqlite-utils enable-fts mydatabase.db items name description

Configuring FTS using csvs-to-sqlite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your data starts out in CSV files, you can use Datasette's companion tool `csvs-to-sqlite <https://github.com/simonw/csvs-to-sqlite>`__ to convert that file into a SQLite database and enable full-text search on specific columns. For a file called ``items.csv`` where you want full-text search to operate against the ``name`` and ``description`` columns you would run the following::

    $ csvs-to-sqlite items.csv items.db -f name -f description

Configuring FTS by hand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend using `sqlite-utils <https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/>`__, but if you want to hand-roll a SQLite full-text search table you can do so using the following SQL.

To enable full-text search for a table called ``items`` that works against the ``name`` and ``description`` columns, you would run this SQL to create a new ``items_fts`` FTS virtual table:

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE "items_fts" USING FTS4 (
        name,
        description,
        content="items"
    );

This creates a set of tables to power full-text search against ``items``. The new ``items_fts`` table will be detected by Datasette as the ``fts_table`` for the ``items`` table.

Creating the table is not enough: you also need to populate it with a copy of the data that you wish to make searchable. You can do that using the following SQL:

.. code-block:: sql

    INSERT INTO "items_fts" (rowid, name, description)
        SELECT rowid, name, description FROM items;

If your table has columns that are foreign key references to other tables you can include that data in your full-text search index using a join. Imagine the ``items`` table has a foreign key column called ``category_id`` which refers to a ``categories`` table - you could create a full-text search table like this:

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE "items_fts" USING FTS4 (
        name,
        description,
        category_name,
        content="items"
    );

And then populate it like this:

.. code-block:: sql

    INSERT INTO "items_fts" (rowid, name, description, category_name)
        SELECT items.rowid,
        items.name,
        items.description,
        categories.name
        FROM items JOIN categories ON items.category_id=categories.id;

You can use this technique to populate the full-text search index from any combination of tables and joins that makes sense for your project.

.. _full_text_search_table_or_view:

Configuring full-text search for a table or view
------------------------------------------------

If a table has a corresponding FTS table set up using the ``content=`` argument to ``CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE`` shown above, Datasette will detect it automatically and add a search interface to the table page for that table.

You can also manually configure which table should be used for full-text search using querystring parameters or :ref:`metadata`. You can set the associated FTS table for a specific table and you can also set one for a view - if you do that, the page for that SQL view will offer a search option.

Use ``?_fts_table=x`` to over-ride the FTS table for a specific page. If the primary key was something other than ``rowid`` you can use ``?_fts_pk=col`` to set that as well. This is particularly useful for views, for example:

https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/searchable_view?_fts_table=searchable_fts&_fts_pk=pk

The ``fts_table`` metadata property can be used to specify an associated FTS table. If the primary key column in your table which was used to populate the FTS table is something other than ``rowid``, you can specify the column to use with the ``fts_pk`` property.

Here is an example which enables full-text search for a ``display_ads`` view which is defined against the ``ads`` table and hence needs to run FTS against the ``ads_fts`` table, using the ``id`` as the primary key::

    {
      "databases": {
        "russian-ads": {
          "tables": {
            "display_ads": {
              "fts_table": "ads_fts",
              "fts_pk": "id"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

The table view API
------------------

Table views that support full-text search can be queried using the ``?_search=TERMS`` querystring parameter. This will run the search against content from all of the columns that have been included in the index.

SQLite full-text search supports wildcards. This means you can easily implement prefix auto-complete by including an asterisk at the end of the search term - for example::

    /dbname/tablename/?_search=rob*

This will return all records containing at least one word that starts with the letters ``rob``.

You can also run searches against just the content of a specific named column by using ``_search_COLNAME=TERMS`` - for example, this would search for just rows where the ``name`` column in the FTS index mentions ``Sarah``::

    /dbname/tablename/?_search_name=Sarah

.. _full_text_search_custom_sql:

Searches using custom SQL
-------------------------

You can include full-text search results in custom SQL queries. The general pattern with SQLite search is to run the search as a sub-select that returns rowid values, then include those rowids in another part of the query.

You can see the syntax for a basic search by running that search on a table page and then clicking "View and edit SQL" to see the underlying SQL. For example, consider this search for `cherry trees in San Francisco <https://san-francisco.datasettes.com/sf-trees/Street_Tree_List?_search=cherry>`_::

    /sf-trees/Street_Tree_List?_search=cherry

If you click `View and edit SQL <https://san-francisco.datasettes.com/sf-trees?sql=select+rowid%2C+*+from+Street_Tree_List+where+rowid+in+(select+rowid+from+[Street_Tree_List_fts]+where+[Street_Tree_List_fts]+match+%3Asearch)+order+by+rowid+limit+101&search=cherry>`_ you'll see that the underlying SQL looks like this:

.. code-block:: sql

    select rowid, * from Street_Tree_List
    where rowid in (
        select rowid from [Street_Tree_List_fts]
        where [Street_Tree_List_fts] match "cherry"
    ) order by rowid limit 101

Getting started
===============

Play with a live demo
---------------------

The best way to experience Datasette for the first time is with a demo:

* `fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com <https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight>`__ shows Datasette running against over 400 datasets imported from the `FiveThirtyEight GitHub repository <https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data>`__.
* `sf-trees.datasettes.com <https://sf-trees.datasettes.com/trees/Street_Tree_List>`__ demonstrates the `datasette-cluster-map <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map>`__ plugin running against 190,000 trees imported from `data.sfgov.org <https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Street-Tree-List/tkzw-k3nq>`__.

.. _glitch:

Try Datasette without installing anything using Glitch
------------------------------------------------------

`Glitch <https://glitch.com/>`__ is a free online tool for building web apps directly from your web browser. You can use Glitch to try out Datasette without needing to install any software on your own computer.

Here's a demo project on Glitch which you can use as the basis for your own experiments:

`glitch.com/~datasette-csvs <https://glitch.com/~datasette-csvs>`__

Glitch allows you to "remix" any project to create your own copy and start editing it in your browser. You can remix the ``datasette-csvs`` project by clicking this button:

.. image:: https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg
   :target: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/datasette-csvs

Find a CSV file and drag it onto the Glitch file explorer panel - ``datasette-csvs`` will automatically convert it to a SQLite database (using `csvs-to-sqlite <https://github.com/simonw/csvs-to-sqlite>`__) and allow you to start exploring it using Datasette.

If your CSV file has a ``latitude`` and ``longitude`` column you can visualize it on a map by uncommenting the ``datasette-cluster-map`` line in the ``requirements.txt`` file using the Glitch file editor.

Need some data? Try this `Public Art Data <https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Public-Art-Data/j7sn-tdzk>`__ for the city of Seattle - hit "Export" and select "CSV" to download it as a CSV file.

For more on how this works, see `Running Datasette on Glitch <https://simonwillison.net/2019/Apr/23/datasette-glitch/>`__.

Using Datasette on your own computer
------------------------------------

First, follow the :ref:`installation` instructions. Now you can run Datasette against a SQLite file on your computer using the following command:

::

    datasette serve path/to/database.db

This will start a web server on port 8001 - visit http://localhost:8001/
to access the web interface.

``serve`` is the default subcommand, you can omit it if you like.

Use Chrome on OS X? You can run datasette against your browser history
like so:

::

     datasette ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History

Now visiting http://localhost:8001/History/downloads will show you a web
interface to browse your downloads data:

.. figure:: https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2017/datasette-downloads.png
   :alt: Downloads table rendered by datasette

http://localhost:8001/History/downloads.json will return that data as
JSON:

::

    {
        "database": "History",
        "columns": [
            "id",
            "current_path",
            "target_path",
            "start_time",
            "received_bytes",
            "total_bytes",
            ...
        ],
        "rows": [
            [
                1,
                "/Users/simonw/Downloads/DropboxInstaller.dmg",
                "/Users/simonw/Downloads/DropboxInstaller.dmg",
                13097290269022132,
                626688,
                0,
                ...
            ]
        ]
    }

http://localhost:8001/History/downloads.json?_shape=objects will return that data as
JSON in a more convenient but less efficient format:

::

    {
        ...
        "rows": [
            {
                "start_time": 13097290269022132,
                "interrupt_reason": 0,
                "hash": "",
                "id": 1,
                "site_url": "",
                "referrer": "https://www.dropbox.com/downloading?src=index",
                ...
            }
        ]
    }

Installation
============

.. note::
    If you just want to try Datasette out you don't need to install anything: see :ref:`glitch`

There are two main options for installing Datasette. You can install it directly
on to your machine, or you can install it using Docker.

.. contents::

Using Docker
------------

A Docker image containing the latest release of Datasette is published to Docker
Hub here: https://hub.docker.com/r/datasetteproject/datasette/

If you have Docker installed (for example with `Docker for Mac
<https://www.docker.com/docker-mac>`_ on OS X) you can download and run this
image like so::

    docker run -p 8001:8001 -v `pwd`:/mnt \
        datasetteproject/datasette \
        datasette -p 8001 -h 0.0.0.0 /mnt/fixtures.db

This will start an instance of Datasette running on your machine's port 8001,
serving the ``fixtures.db`` file in your current directory.

Now visit http://127.0.0.1:8001/ to access Datasette.

(You can download a copy of ``fixtures.db`` from
https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures.db )

Loading Spatialite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``datasetteproject/datasette`` image includes a recent version of the
:ref:`SpatiaLite extension <spatialite>` for SQLite. To load and enable that
module, use the following command::

    docker run -p 8001:8001 -v `pwd`:/mnt \
        datasetteproject/datasette \
        datasette -p 8001 -h 0.0.0.0 /mnt/fixtures.db \
        --load-extension=/usr/local/lib/mod_spatialite.so

You can confirm that SpatiaLite is successfully loaded by visiting
http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/versions

Installing plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to install plugins into your local Datasette Docker image you can do
so using the following recipe. This will install the plugins and then save a
brand new local image called ``datasette-with-plugins``::

    docker run datasetteproject/datasette \
        pip install datasette-vega

    docker commit $(docker ps -lq) datasette-with-plugins

You can now run the new custom image like so::

    docker run -p 8001:8001 -v `pwd`:/mnt \
        datasette-with-plugins \
        datasette -p 8001 -h 0.0.0.0 /mnt/fixtures.db

You can confirm that the plugins are installed by visiting
http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/plugins


Install using pip
-----------------

To run Datasette without Docker you will need Python 3.5 or higher.

You can install Datasette and its dependencies using ``pip``::

    pip install datasette

If you want to install Datasette in its own virtual environment, use this::

    python -mvenv datasette-venv
    source datasette-venv/bin/activate
    pip install datasette

You can now run Datasette like so::

    datasette fixtures.db

If you want to start making contributions to the Datasette project by installing a copy that lets you directly modify the code, take a look at our guide to :ref:`devenvironment`.

<document index="12">
<source>docs/introspection.rst</source>
<document_content>
Introspection
=============

Datasette includes some pages and JSON API endpoints for introspecting the current instance. These can be used to understand some of the internals of Datasette and to see how a particular instance has been configured.

Each of these pages can be viewed in your browser. Add ``.json`` to the URL to get back the contents as JSON.

.. _JsonDataView_metadata:

/-/metadata
-----------

Shows the contents of the ``metadata.json`` file that was passed to ``datasette serve``, if any. `Metadata example <https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/-/metadata>`_::

JSON API
========

Datasette provides a JSON API for your SQLite databases. Anything you can do
through the Datasette user interface can also be accessed as JSON via the API.

To access the API for a page, either click on the ``.json`` link on that page or
edit the URL and add a ``.json`` extension to it.

If you started Datasette with the ``--cors`` option, each JSON endpoint will be
served with the following additional HTTP header::

    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

This means JavaScript running on any domain will be able to make cross-origin
requests to fetch the data.

If you start Datasette without the ``--cors`` option only JavaScript running on
the same domain as Datasette will be able to access the API.

Different shapes
----------------

The default JSON representation of data from a SQLite table or custom query
looks like this::

    {
        "database": "sf-trees",
        "table": "qSpecies",
        "columns": [
            "id",
            "value"
        ],
        "rows": [
            [
                1,
                "Myoporum laetum :: Myoporum"
            ],
            [
                2,
                "Metrosideros excelsa :: New Zealand Xmas Tree"
            ],
            [
                3,
                "Pinus radiata :: Monterey Pine"
            ]
        ],
        "truncated": false,
        "next": "100",
        "next_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8001/sf-trees-02c8ef1/qSpecies.json?_next=100",
        "query_ms": 1.9571781158447266
    }

The ``columns`` key lists the columns that are being returned, and the ``rows``
key then returns a list of lists, each one representing a row. The order of the
values in each row corresponds to the columns.

The ``_shape`` parameter can be used to access alternative formats for the
``rows`` key which may be more convenient for your application. There are three
options:

* ``?_shape=arrays`` - ``"rows"`` is the default option, shown above
* ``?_shape=objects`` - ``"rows"`` is a list of JSON key/value objects
* ``?_shape=array`` - an JSON array of objects
* ``?_shape=array&_nl=on`` - a newline-separated list of JSON objects
* ``?_shape=arrayfirst`` - a flat JSON array containing just the first value from each row
* ``?_shape=object`` - a JSON object keyed using the primary keys of the rows

``_shape=objects`` looks like this::

    {
        "database": "sf-trees",
        ...
        "rows": [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "value": "Myoporum laetum :: Myoporum"
            },
            {
                "id": 2,
                "value": "Metrosideros excelsa :: New Zealand Xmas Tree"
            },
            {
                "id": 3,
                "value": "Pinus radiata :: Monterey Pine"
            }
        ]
    }

``_shape=array`` looks like this::

    [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "value": "Myoporum laetum :: Myoporum"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "value": "Metrosideros excelsa :: New Zealand Xmas Tree"
        },
        {
            "id": 3,
            "value": "Pinus radiata :: Monterey Pine"
        }
    ]

``_shape=array&_nl=on`` looks like this::

    {"id": 1, "value": "Myoporum laetum :: Myoporum"}
    {"id": 2, "value": "Metrosideros excelsa :: New Zealand Xmas Tree"}
    {"id": 3, "value": "Pinus radiata :: Monterey Pine"}

``_shape=arrayfirst`` looks like this::

    [1, 2, 3]

``_shape=object`` looks like this::

    {
        "1": {
            "id": 1,
            "value": "Myoporum laetum :: Myoporum"
        },
        "2": {
            "id": 2,
            "value": "Metrosideros excelsa :: New Zealand Xmas Tree"
        },
        "3": {
            "id": 3,
            "value": "Pinus radiata :: Monterey Pine"
        }
    ]

The ``object`` shape is only available for queries against tables - custom SQL
queries and views do not have an obvious primary key so cannot be returned using
this format.

The ``object`` keys are always strings. If your table has a compound primary
key, the ``object`` keys will be a comma-separated string.

Special JSON arguments
----------------------

Every Datasette endpoint that can return JSON also accepts the following
querystring arguments:

``?_shape=SHAPE``
    The shape of the JSON to return, documented above.

``?_nl=on``
    When used with ``?_shape=array`` produces newline-delimited JSON objects.

``?_json=COLUMN1&_json=COLUMN2``
    If any of your SQLite columns contain JSON values, you can use one or more
    ``_json=`` parameters to request that those columns be returned as regular
    JSON. Without this argument those columns will be returned as JSON objects
    that have been double-encoded into a JSON string value.

    Compare `this query without the argument <https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight.json?sql=select+%27{%22this+is%22%3A+%22a+json+object%22}%27+as+d&_shape=array>`_ to `this query using the argument <https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight.json?sql=select+%27{%22this+is%22%3A+%22a+json+object%22}%27+as+d&_shape=array&_json=d>`_

``?_json_infinity=on``
    If your data contains infinity or -infinity values, Datasette will replace
    them with None when returning them as JSON. If you pass ``_json_infinity=1``
    Datasette will instead return them as ``Infinity`` or ``-Infinity`` which is
    invalid JSON but can be processed by some custom JSON parsers.

``?_timelimit=MS``
    Sets a custom time limit for the query in ms. You can use this for optimistic
    queries where you would like Datasette to give up if the query takes too
    long, for example if you want to implement autocomplete search but only if
    it can be executed in less than 10ms.

``?_ttl=SECONDS``
    For how many seconds should this response be cached by HTTP proxies? Use
    ``?_ttl=0`` to disable HTTP caching entirely for this request.

.. _table_arguments:

Table arguments
---------------

The Datasette table view takes a number of special querystring arguments.

Column filter arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can filter the data returned by the table based on column values using a querystring argument.

``?column__exact=value`` or ``?_column=value``
    Returns rows where the specified column exactly matches the value.

``?column__not=value``
    Returns rows where the column does not match the value.

``?column__contains=value``
    Rows where the string column contains the specified value (``column like "%value%"`` in SQL).

``?column__endswith=value``
    Rows where the string column ends with the specified value (``column like "%value"`` in SQL).

``?column__startswith=value``
    Rows where the string column starts with the specified value (``column like "value%"`` in SQL).

``?column__gt=value``
    Rows which are greater than the specified value.

``?column__gte=value``
    Rows which are greater than or equal to the specified value.

``?column__lt=value``
    Rows which are less than the specified value.

``?column__lte=value``
    Rows which are less than or equal to the specified value.

``?column__like=value``
    Match rows with a LIKE clause, case insensitive and with ``%`` as the wildcard character.

``?column__glob=value``
    Similar to LIKE but uses Unix wildcard syntax and is case sensitive.

``?column__in=value1,value2,value3``
    Rows where column matches any of the provided values.

    You can use a comma separated string, or you can use a JSON array.

    The JSON array option is useful if one of your matching values itself contains a comma:

    ``?column__in=["value","value,with,commas"]``

``?column__arraycontains=value``
    Works against columns that contain JSON arrays - matches if any of the values in that array match.

    This is only available if the ``json1`` SQLite extension is enabled.

``?column__date=value``
    Column is a datestamp occurring on the specified YYYY-MM-DD date, e.g. ``2018-01-02``.

``?column__isnull=1``
    Matches rows where the column is null.

``?column__notnull=1``
    Matches rows where the column is not null.

``?column__isblank=1``
    Matches rows where the column is blank, meaning null or the empty string.

``?column__notblank=1``
    Matches rows where the column is not blank.

.. _json_api_table_arguments:

Special table arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``?_labels=on/off``
    Expand foreign key references for every possible column. See below.

``?_label=COLUMN1&_label=COLUMN2``
    Expand foreign key references for one or more specified columns.

``?_size=1000`` or ``?_size=max``
    Sets a custom page size. This cannot exceed the ``max_returned_rows`` limit
    passed to ``datasette serve``. Use ``max`` to get ``max_returned_rows``.

``?_sort=COLUMN``
    Sorts the results by the specified column.

``?_sort_desc=COLUMN``
    Sorts the results by the specified column in descending order.

``?_search=keywords``
    For SQLite tables that have been configured for
    `full-text search <https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html>`_ executes a search
    with the provided keywords.

``?_search_COLUMN=keywords``
    Like ``_search=`` but allows you to specify the column to be searched, as
    opposed to searching all columns that have been indexed by FTS.

``?_where=SQL-fragment``
    If the :ref:`config_allow_sql` config option is enabled, this parameter
    can be used to pass one or more additional SQL fragments to be used in the
    `WHERE` clause of the SQL used to query the table.

    This is particularly useful if you are building a JavaScript application
    that needs to do something creative but still wants the other conveniences
    provided by the table view (such as faceting) and hence would like not to
    have to construct a completely custom SQL query.

    Some examples:

    * `facetable?_where=neighborhood like "%c%"&_where=city_id=3 <https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable?_where=neighborhood%20like%20%22%c%%22&_where=city_id=3>`__
    * `facetable?_where=city_id in (select id from facet_cities where name != "Detroit") <https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable?_where=city_id%20in%20(select%20id%20from%20facet_cities%20where%20name%20!=%20%22Detroit%22)>`__

``?_through={json}``
    This can be used to filter rows via a join against another table.

    The JSON parameter must include three keys: ``table``, ``column`` and ``value``.

    ``table`` must be a table that the current table is related to via a foreign key relationship.

    ``column`` must be a column in that other table.

    ``value`` is the value that you want to match against.

    For example, to filter ``roadside_attractions`` to just show the attractions that have a characteristic of "museum", you would construct this JSON::

        {
            "table": "roadside_attraction_characteristics",
            "column": "characteristic_id",
            "value": "1"
        }

    As a URL, that looks like this:

    ``?_through={%22table%22:%22roadside_attraction_characteristics%22,%22column%22:%22characteristic_id%22,%22value%22:%221%22}``

    Here's `an example <https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/roadside_attractions?_through={%22table%22:%22roadside_attraction_characteristics%22,%22column%22:%22characteristic_id%22,%22value%22:%221%22}>`__.


``?_group_count=COLUMN``
    Executes a SQL query that returns a count of the number of rows matching
    each unique value in that column, with the most common ordered first.

``?_group_count=COLUMN1&_group_count=column2``
    You can pass multiple ``_group_count`` columns to return counts against
    unique combinations of those columns.

``?_next=TOKEN``
    Pagination by continuation token - pass the token that was returned in the
    ``"next"`` property by the previous page.

``?_trace=1``
    Turns on tracing for this page: SQL queries executed during the request will
    be gathered and included in the response, either in a new ``"_traces"`` key
    for JSON responses or at the bottom of the page if the response is in HTML.

    The structure of the data returned here should be considered highly unstable
    and very likely to change.

.. _expand_foreign_keys:

Expanding foreign key references
--------------------------------

Datasette can detect foreign key relationships and resolve those references into
labels. The HTML interface does this by default for every detected foreign key
column - you can turn that off using ``?_labels=off``.

You can request foreign keys be expanded in JSON using the ``_labels=on`` or
``_label=COLUMN`` special querystring parameters. Here's what an expanded row
looks like::

    [
        {
            "rowid": 1,
            "TreeID": 141565,
            "qLegalStatus": {
                "value": 1,
                "label": "Permitted Site"
            },
            "qSpecies": {
                "value": 1,
                "label": "Myoporum laetum :: Myoporum"
            },
            "qAddress": "501X Baker St",
            "SiteOrder": 1
        }
    ]

The column in the foreign key table that is used for the label can be specified
in ``metadata.json`` - see :ref:`label_columns`.

.. _metadata:

Metadata
========

Data loves metadata. Any time you run Datasette you can optionally include a
JSON file with metadata about your databases and tables. Datasette will then
display that information in the web UI.

Run Datasette like this::

    datasette database1.db database2.db --metadata metadata.json

Your ``metadata.json`` file can look something like this::

    {
        "title": "Custom title for your index page",
        "description": "Some description text can go here",
        "license": "ODbL",
        "license_url": "https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/",
        "source": "Original Data Source",
        "source_url": "http://example.com/"
    }

The above metadata will be displayed on the index page of your Datasette-powered
site. The source and license information will also be included in the footer of
every page served by Datasette.

Any special HTML characters in ``description`` will be escaped. If you want to
include HTML in your description, you can use a ``description_html`` property
instead.

Per-database and per-table metadata
-----------------------------------

Metadata at the top level of the JSON will be shown on the index page and in the
footer on every page of the site. The license and source is expected to apply to
all of your data.

You can also provide metadata at the per-database or per-table level, like this::

    {
        "databases": {
            "database1": {
                "source": "Alternative source",
                "source_url": "http://example.com/",
                "tables": {
                    "example_table": {
                        "description_html": "Custom <em>table</em> description",
                        "license": "CC BY 3.0 US",
                        "license_url": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

Each of the top-level metadata fields can be used at the database and table level.

.. _metadata_source_license_about:

Source, license and about
-------------------------

The three visible metadata fields you can apply to everything, specific databases or specific tables are source, license and about. All three are optional.

**source** and **source_url** should be used to indicate where the underlying data came from.

**license** and **license_url** should be used to indicate the license under which the data can be used.

**about** and **about_url** can be used to link to further information about the project - an accompanying blog entry for example.

For each of these you can provide just the ``*_url`` field and Datasette will treat that as the default link label text and display the URL directly on the page.

Specifying units for a column
-----------------------------

Datasette supports attaching units to a column, which will be used when displaying
values from that column. SI prefixes will be used where appropriate.

Column units are configured in the metadata like so::

    {
        "databases": {
            "database1": {
                "tables": {
                    "example_table": {
                        "units": {
                            "column1": "metres",
                            "column2": "Hz"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

Units are interpreted using Pint_, and you can see the full list of available units in
Pint's `unit registry`_. You can also add `custom units`_ to the metadata, which will be
registered with Pint::

    {
        "custom_units": [
            "decibel = [] = dB"
        ]
    }

.. _Pint: https://pint.readthedocs.io/
.. _unit registry: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/blob/master/pint/default_en.txt
.. _custom units: http://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/defining.html

.. _metadata_sortable_columns:

Setting which columns can be used for sorting
---------------------------------------------

Datasette allows any column to be used for sorting by default. If you need to
control which columns are available for sorting you can do so using the optional
``sortable_columns`` key::

    {
        "databases": {
            "database1": {
                "tables": {
                    "example_table": {
                        "sortable_columns": [
                            "height",
                            "weight"
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

This will restrict sorting of ``example_table`` to just the ``height`` and
``weight`` columns.

You can also disable sorting entirely by setting ``"sortable_columns": []``

By default, database views in Datasette do not support sorting. You can use ``sortable_columns`` to enable specific sort orders for a view called ``name_of_view`` in the database ``my_database`` like so::

    {
        "databases": {
            "my_database": {
                "tables": {
                    "name_of_view": {
                        "sortable_columns": [
                            "clicks",
                            "impressions"
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

.. _label_columns:

Specifying the label column for a table
---------------------------------------

Datasette's HTML interface attempts to display foreign key references as
labelled hyperlinks. By default, it looks for referenced tables that only have
two columns: a primary key column and one other. It assumes that the second
column should be used as the link label.

If your table has more than two columns you can specify which column should be
used for the link label with the ``label_column`` property::

    {
        "databases": {
            "database1": {
                "tables": {
                    "example_table": {
                        "label_column": "title"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

Hiding tables
-------------

You can hide tables from the database listing view (in the same way that FTS and
Spatialite tables are automatically hidden) using ``"hidden": true``::

    {
        "databases": {
            "database1": {
                "tables": {
                    "example_table": {
                        "hidden": true
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

.. _pages:

=========================
 Pages and API endpoints
=========================

The Datasette web application offers a number of different pages that can be accessed to explore the data in question, each of which is accompanied by an equivalent JSON API.

.. _IndexView:

Top-level index
===============

The root page of any Datasette installation is an index page that lists all of the currently attached databases. Some examples:

* `fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com <https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/>`_
* `global-power-plants.datasettes.com <https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/>`_
* `register-of-members-interests.datasettes.com <https://register-of-members-interests.datasettes.com/>`_

Add ``/.json`` to the end of the URL for the JSON version of the underlying data:

* `fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/.json <https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/.json>`_
* `global-power-plants.datasettes.com/.json <https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/.json>`_
* `register-of-members-interests.datasettes.com/.json <https://register-of-members-interests.datasettes.com/.json>`_

.. _DatabaseView:

Database
========

Each database has a page listing the tables, views and canned queries
available for that database. If the :ref:`config_allow_sql` config option is enabled (it's turned on by default) there will also be an interface for executing arbitrary SQL select queries against the data.

Examples:

* `fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight-ac35616 <https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight-ac35616>`_
* `global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants-9e55be2 <https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants-9e55be2>`_

The JSON version of this page provides programmatic access to the underlying data:

* `fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight-ac35616.json <https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight-ac35616.json>`_
* `global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants-9e55be2.json <https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants-9e55be2.json>`_

Note that these URLs end in a 7 character hash. This hash is derived from the contents of the database, and ensures that each URL is immutable: the data returned from a URL containing the hash will always be the same, since if the contents of the database file changes by even a single byte a new hash will be generated.

If you access one of these URLs with an incorrect hash (say because a new version of the underlying database has been published) Datasette will 302 redirect you to the correct URL. This happens for all URLs below the database page as well.

Thanks to this hashing scheme, Datasette URLs can all be returned with far-future cache expiry headers. This means browsers will cache the data (including data from the JSON APIs) for a long time, and CDNs such as `Cloudflare <https://www.cloudflare.com/>`_ or `Fastly <https://www.cloudflare.com/>`_ can be used to dramatically improve the performance of a Datasette hosted API.

.. _TableView:

Table
=====

The table page is the heart of Datasette: it allows users to interactively explore the contents of a database table, including sorting, filtering, :ref:`full_text_search` and applying :ref:`facets`.

The HTML interface is worth spending some time exploring. As with other pages, you can return the JSON data by appending ``.json`` to the URL path, before any `?` querystring arguments.

The querystring arguments are described in more detail here: :ref:`table_arguments`

You can also use the table page to interactively construct a SQL query - by applying different filters and a sort order for example - and then click the "View and edit SQL" link to see the SQL query that was used for the page and edit and re-submit it.

Some examples:

* `../items <https://register-of-members-interests.datasettes.com/regmem-d22c12c/items>`_ lists all of the line-items registered by UK MPs as potential conflicts of interest. It demonstrates Datasette's support for :ref:`full_text_search`.
* `../antiquities-act%2Factions_under_antiquities_act <https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight-ac35616/antiquities-act%2Factions_under_antiquities_act>`_ is an interface for exploring the "actions under the antiquities act" data table published by FiveThirtyEight.
* `../global-power-plants?country_long=United+Kingdom&primary_fuel=Gas <https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants/global-power-plants?_facet=primary_fuel&_facet=owner&_facet=country_long&country_long__exact=United+Kingdom&primary_fuel=Gas>`_ is a filtered table page showing every Gas power plant in the United Kingdom. It includes some default facets (configured using `its metadata.json <https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/-/metadata>`_) and uses the `datasette-cluster-map <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map>`_ plugin to show a map of the results.

.. _RowView:

Row
===

Every row in every Datasette table has its own URL. This means individual records can be linked to directly.

Table cells with extremely long text contents are truncated on the table view according to the :ref:`config_truncate_cells_html` setting. If a cell has been truncated the full length version of that cell will be available on the row page.

Rows which are the targets of foreign key references from other tables will show a link to a filtered search for all records that reference that row. Here's an example from the Registers of Members Interests database:

`../people/uk.org.publicwhip%2Fperson%2F10001 <https://register-of-members-interests.datasettes.com/regmem-d22c12c/people/uk.org.publicwhip%2Fperson%2F10001>`_

Note that this URL includes the encoded primary key of the record.

Here's that same page as JSON:

`../people/uk.org.publicwhip%2Fperson%2F10001.json <https://register-of-members-interests.datasettes.com/regmem-d22c12c/people/uk.org.publicwhip%2Fperson%2F10001.json>`_

.. _performance:

Performance and caching
=======================

Datasette runs on top of SQLite, and SQLite has excellent performance.  For small databases almost any query should return in just a few milliseconds, and larger databases (100s of MBs or even GBs of data) should perform extremely well provided your queries make sensible use of database indexes.

That said, there are a number of tricks you can use to improve Datasette's performance.

.. _performance_immutable_mode:

Immutable mode
--------------

If you can be certain that a SQLite database file will not be changed by another process you can tell Datasette to open that file in *immutable mode*.

Doing so will disable all locking and change detection, which can result in improved query performance.

This also enables further optimizations relating to HTTP caching, described below.

To open a file in immutable mode pass it to the datasette command using the ``-i`` option::

    datasette -i data.db

When you open a file in immutable mode like this Datasette will also calculate and cache the row counts for each table in that database when it first starts up, further improving performance.

Using "datasette inspect"
-------------------------

Counting the rows in a table can be a very expensive operation on larger databases. In immutable mode Datasette performs this count only once and caches the results, but this can still cause server startup time to increase by several seconds or more.

If you know that a database is never going to change you can precalculate the table row counts once and store then in a JSON file, then use that file when you later start the server.

To create a JSON file containing the calculated row counts for a database, use the following::

    datasette inspect data.db --inspect-file=counts.json

Then later you can start Datasette against the ``counts.json`` file and use it to skip the row counting step and speed up server startup::

    datasette -i data.db --inspect-file=counts.json

You need to use the ``-i`` immutable mode against the databse file here or the counts from the JSON file will be ignored.

You will rarely need to use this optimization in every-day use, but several of the ``datasette publish`` commands described in :ref:`publishing` use this optimization for better performance when deploying a database file to a hosting provider.

HTTP caching
------------

If your database is immutable and guaranteed not to change, you can gain major performance improvements from Datasette by enabling HTTP caching.

This can work at two different levels. First, it can tell browsers to cache the results of queries and serve future requests from the browser cache.

More significantly, it allows you to run Datasette behind a caching proxy such as `Varnish <https://varnish-cache.org/>`__ or use a cache provided by a hosted service such as `Fastly <https://www.fastly.com/>`__ or `Cloudflare <https://www.cloudflare.com/>`__. This can provide incredible speed-ups since a query only needs to be executed by Datasette the first time it is accessed - all subsequent hits can then be served by the cache.

Using a caching proxy in this way could enable a Datasette-backed visualization to serve thousands of hits a second while running Datasette itself on extremely inexpensive hosting.

Datasette's integration with HTTP caches can be enabled using a combination of configuration options and querystring arguments.

The :ref:`config_default_cache_ttl` setting sets the default HTTP cache TTL for all Datasette pages. This is 5 seconds unless you change it - you can set it to 0 if you wish to disable HTTP caching entirely.

You can also change the cache timeout on a per-request basis using the ``?_ttl=10`` querystring parameter. This can be useful when you are working with the Datasette JSON API - you may decide that a specific query can be cached for a longer time, or maybe you need to set ``?_ttl=0`` for some requests for example if you are running a SQL ``order by random()`` query.

Hashed URL mode
---------------

When you open a database file in immutable mode using the ``-i`` option, Datasette calculates a SHA-256 hash of the contents of that file on startup. This content hash can then optionally be used to create URLs that are guaranteed to change if the contents of the file changes in the future. This results in URLs that can then be cached indefinitely by both browsers and caching proxies - an enormous potential performance optimization.

You can enable these hashed URLs in two ways: using the :ref:`config_hash_urls` configuration setting (which affects all requests to Datasette) or via the ``?_hash=1`` querystring parameter (which only applies to the current request).

With hashed URLs enabled, any request to e.g. ``/mydatabase/mytable`` will 302 redirect to ``mydatabase-455fe3a/mytable``. The URL containing the hash will be served with a very long cache expire header - configured using :ref:`config_default_cache_ttl_hashed` which defaults to 365 days.

Since these responses are cached for a long time, you may wish to build API clients against the non-hashed version of these URLs. These 302 redirects are served extremely quickly, so this should still be a performant way to work against the Datasette API.

If you run Datasette behind an `HTTP/2 server push <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2_Server_Push>`__ aware proxy such as Cloudflare Datasette will serve the 302 redirects in such a way that the redirected page will be efficiently "pushed" to the browser as part of the response, without the browser needing to make a second HTTP request to fetch the redirected resource.

.. note::
    Prior to Datasette 0.28 hashed URL mode was the default behaviour for Datasette, since all database files were assumed to be immutable and unchanging. From 0.28 onwards the default has been to treat database files as mutable unless explicitly configured otherwise.

.. _plugins:

Plugins
=======

Datasette's plugin system allows additional features to be implemented as Python
code (or front-end JavaScript) which can be wrapped up in a separate Python
package. The underlying mechanism uses `pluggy <https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Using plugins
-------------

If a plugin has been packaged for distribution using setuptools you can use
the plugin by installing it alongside Datasette in the same virtual
environment or Docker container.

You can also define one-off per-project plugins by saving them as
``plugin_name.py`` functions in a ``plugins/`` folder and then passing that
folder to ``datasette serve``.

The ``datasette publish`` and ``datasette package`` commands both take an
optional ``--install`` argument. You can use this one or more times to tell
Datasette to ``pip install`` specific plugins as part of the process. You can
use the name of a package on PyPI or any of the other valid arguments to ``pip
install`` such as a URL to a ``.zip`` file::

    datasette publish cloudrun mydb.db \
        --install=datasette-plugin-demos \
        --install=https://url-to-my-package.zip

Writing plugins
---------------

The easiest way to write a plugin is to create a ``my_plugin.py`` file and
drop it into your ``plugins/`` directory. Here is an example plugin, which
adds a new custom SQL function called ``hello_world()`` which takes no
arguments and returns the string ``Hello world!``.

.. code-block:: python

    from datasette import hookimpl

    @hookimpl
    def prepare_connection(conn):
        conn.create_function('hello_world', 0, lambda: 'Hello world!')

If you save this in ``plugins/my_plugin.py`` you can then start Datasette like
this::

    datasette serve mydb.db --plugins-dir=plugins/

Now you can navigate to http://localhost:8001/mydb and run this SQL::

    select hello_world();

To see the output of your plugin.

.. _plugins_installed:

Seeing what plugins are installed
---------------------------------

You can see a list of installed plugins by navigating to the ``/-/plugins`` page of your Datasette instance - for example: https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/-/plugins

You can also use the ``datasette plugins`` command::

    $ datasette plugins
    [
        {
            "name": "datasette_json_html",
            "static": false,
            "templates": false,
            "version": "0.4.0"
        }
    ]

If you run ``datasette plugins --all`` it will include default plugins that ship as part of Datasette::

    $ datasette plugins --all
    [
        {
            "name": "datasette_json_html",
            "static": false,
            "templates": false,
            "version": "0.4.0"
        },
        {
            "name": "datasette.publish.heroku",
            "static": false,
            "templates": false,
            "version": null
        },
        {
            "name": "datasette.publish.now",
            "static": false,
            "templates": false,
            "version": null
        }
    ]

You can add the ``--plugins-dir=`` option to include any plugins found in that directory.

Packaging a plugin
------------------

Plugins can be packaged using Python setuptools. You can see an example of a
packaged plugin at https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-demos

The example consists of two files: a ``setup.py`` file that defines the plugin:

.. code-block:: python

    from setuptools import setup

    VERSION = '0.1'

    setup(
        name='datasette-plugin-demos',
        description='Examples of plugins for Datasette',
        author='Simon Willison',
        url='https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-demos',
        license='Apache License, Version 2.0',
        version=VERSION,
        py_modules=['datasette_plugin_demos'],
        entry_points={
            'datasette': [
                'plugin_demos = datasette_plugin_demos'
            ]
        },
        install_requires=['datasette']
    )

And a Python module file, ``datasette_plugin_demos.py``, that implements the
plugin:

.. code-block:: python

    from datasette import hookimpl
    import random


    @hookimpl
    def prepare_jinja2_environment(env):
        env.filters['uppercase'] = lambda u: u.upper()


    @hookimpl
    def prepare_connection(conn):
        conn.create_function('random_integer', 2, random.randint)


Having built a plugin in this way you can turn it into an installable package
using the following command::

    python3 setup.py sdist

This will create a ``.tar.gz`` file in the ``dist/`` directory.

You can then install your new plugin into a Datasette virtual environment or
Docker container using ``pip``::

    pip install datasette-plugin-demos-0.1.tar.gz

To learn how to upload your plugin to `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_ for use by
other people, read the PyPA guide to `Packaging and distributing projects
<https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/>`_.

Static assets
-------------

If your plugin has a ``static/`` directory, Datasette will automatically
configure itself to serve those static assets from the following path::

    /-/static-plugins/NAME_OF_PLUGIN_PACKAGE/yourfile.js

See `the datasette-plugin-demos repository <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-demos/tree/0ccf9e6189e923046047acd7878d1d19a2cccbb1>`_
for an example of how to create a package that includes a static folder.

Custom templates
----------------

If your plugin has a ``templates/`` directory, Datasette will attempt to load
templates from that directory before it uses its own default templates.

The priority order for template loading is:

* templates from the ``--template-dir`` argument, if specified
* templates from the ``templates/`` directory in any installed plugins
* default templates that ship with Datasette

See :ref:`customization` for more details on how to write custom templates,
including which filenames to use to customize which parts of the Datasette UI.

.. _plugins_configuration:

Plugin configuration
--------------------

Plugins can have their own configuration, embedded in a :ref:`metadata` file. Configuration options for plugins live within a ``"plugins"`` key in that file, which can be included at the root, database or table level.

Here is an example of some plugin configuration for a specific table::

    {
        "databases: {
            "sf-trees": {
                "tables": {
                    "Street_Tree_List": {
                        "plugins": {
                            "datasette-cluster-map": {
                                "latitude_column": "lat",
                                "longitude_column": "lng"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

This tells the ``datasette-cluster-map`` column which latitude and longitude columns should be used for a table called ``Street_Tree_List`` inside a database file called ``sf-trees.db``.

.. _plugins_configuration_secret:

Secret configuration values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any values embedded in ``metadata.json`` will be visible to anyone who views the ``/-/metadata`` page of your Datasette instance. Some plugins may need configuration that should stay secret - API keys for example. There are two ways in which you can store secret configuration values.

**As environment variables**. If your secret lives in an environment variable that is available to the Datasette process, you can indicate that the configuration value should be read from that environment variable like so::

    {
        "plugins": {
            "datasette-auth-github": {
                "client_secret": {
                    "$env": "GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET"
                }
            }
        }
    }

**As values in separate files**. Your secrets can also live in files on disk. To specify a secret should be read from a file, provide the full file path like this::

    {
        "plugins": {
            "datasette-auth-github": {
                "client_secret": {
                    "$file": "/secrets/client-secret"
                }
            }
        }
    }

If you are publishing your data using the :ref:`datasette publish <cli_publish>` family of commands, you can use the ``--plugin-secret`` option to set these secrets at publish time. For example, using Heroku you might run the following command::

    $ datasette publish heroku my_database.db \
        --name my-heroku-app-demo \
        --install=datasette-auth-github \
        --plugin-secret datasette-auth-github client_id your_client_id \
        --plugin-secret datasette-auth-github client_secret your_client_secret

Writing plugins that accept configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you are writing plugins, you can access plugin configuration like this using the ``datasette.plugin_config()`` method. If you know you need plugin configuration for a specific table, you can access it like this::

    plugin_config = datasette.plugin_config(
        "datasette-cluster-map", database="sf-trees", table="Street_Tree_List"
    )

This will return the ``{"latitude_column": "lat", "longitude_column": "lng"}`` in the above example.

If it cannot find the requested configuration at the table layer, it will fall back to the database layer and then the root layer. For example, a user may have set the plugin configuration option like so::

    {
        "databases: {
            "sf-trees": {
                "plugins": {
                    "datasette-cluster-map": {
                        "latitude_column": "xlat",
                        "longitude_column": "xlng"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

In this case, the above code would return that configuration for ANY table within the ``sf-trees`` database.

The plugin configuration could also be set at the top level of ``metadata.json``::

    {
        "title": "This is the top-level title in metadata.json",
        "plugins": {
            "datasette-cluster-map": {
                "latitude_column": "xlat",
                "longitude_column": "xlng"
            }
        }
    }

Now that ``datasette-cluster-map`` plugin configuration will apply to every table in every database.

Plugin hooks
------------

When you implement a plugin hook you can accept any or all of the parameters that are documented as being passed to that hook. For example, you can implement a ``render_cell`` plugin hook like this even though the hook definition defines more parameters than just ``value`` and ``column``:

.. code-block:: python

    @hookimpl
    def render_cell(value, column):
        if column == "stars":
            return "*" * int(value)

The full list of available plugin hooks is as follows.

.. _plugin_hook_prepare_connection:

prepare_connection(conn)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``conn`` - sqlite3 connection object
    The connection that is being opened

This hook is called when a new SQLite database connection is created. You can
use it to `register custom SQL functions <https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.create_function>`_,
aggregates and collations. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from datasette import hookimpl
    import random

    @hookimpl
    def prepare_connection(conn):
        conn.create_function('random_integer', 2, random.randint)

This registers a SQL function called ``random_integer`` which takes two
arguments and can be called like this::

    select random_integer(1, 10);

.. _plugin_hook_prepare_jinja2_environment:

prepare_jinja2_environment(env)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``env`` - jinja2 Environment
    The template environment that is being prepared

This hook is called with the Jinja2 environment that is used to evaluate
Datasette HTML templates. You can use it to do things like `register custom
template filters <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/api/#custom-filters>`_, for
example:

.. code-block:: python

    from datasette import hookimpl

    @hookimpl
    def prepare_jinja2_environment(env):
        env.filters['uppercase'] = lambda u: u.upper()

You can now use this filter in your custom templates like so::

    Table name: {{ table|uppercase }}

.. _plugin_hook_extra_css_urls:

extra_css_urls(template, database, table, datasette)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``template`` - string
    The template that is being rendered, e.g. ``database.html``

``database`` - string or None
    The name of the database

``table`` - string or None
    The name of the table

``datasette`` - Datasette instance
    You can use this to access plugin configuration options via ``datasette.plugin_config(your_plugin_name)``

Return a list of extra CSS URLs that should be included on the page. These can
take advantage of the CSS class hooks described in :ref:`customization`.

This can be a list of URLs:

.. code-block:: python

    from datasette import hookimpl

    @hookimpl
    def extra_css_urls():
        return [
            'https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.0/css/bootstrap.min.css'
        ]

Or a list of dictionaries defining both a URL and an
`SRI hash <https://www.srihash.org/>`_:

.. code-block:: python

    from datasette import hookimpl

    @hookimpl
    def extra_css_urls():
        return [{
            'url': 'https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.0/css/bootstrap.min.css',
            'sri': 'sha384-9gVQ4dYFwwWSjIDZnLEWnxCjeSWFphJiwGPXr1jddIhOegiu1FwO5qRGvFXOdJZ4',
        }]

.. _plugin_hook_extra_js_urls:

extra_js_urls(template, database, table, datasette)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Same arguments as ``extra_css_urls``.

This works in the same way as ``extra_css_urls()`` but for JavaScript. You can
return either a list of URLs or a list of dictionaries:

.. code-block:: python

    from datasette import hookimpl

    @hookimpl
    def extra_js_urls():
        return [{
            'url': 'https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js',
            'sri': 'sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo',
        }]

You can also return URLs to files from your plugin's ``static/`` directory, if
you have one:

.. code-block:: python

    from datasette import hookimpl

    @hookimpl
    def extra_js_urls():
        return [
            '/-/static-plugins/your-plugin/app.js'
        ]

.. _plugin_hook_publish_subcommand:

publish_subcommand(publish)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``publish`` - Click publish command group
    The Click command group for the ``datasette publish`` subcommand

This hook allows you to create new providers for the ``datasette publish``
command. Datasette uses this hook internally to implement the default ``now``
and ``heroku`` subcommands, so you can read
`their source <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/tree/master/datasette/publish>`_
to see examples of this hook in action.

Let's say you want to build a plugin that adds a ``datasette publish my_hosting_provider --api_key=xxx mydatabase.db`` publish command. Your implementation would start like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from datasette import hookimpl
    from datasette.publish.common import add_common_publish_arguments_and_options
    import click


    @hookimpl
    def publish_subcommand(publish):
        @publish.command()
        @add_common_publish_arguments_and_options
        @click.option(
            "-k",
            "--api_key",
            help="API key for talking to my hosting provider",
        )
        def my_hosting_provider(
            files,
            metadata,
            extra_options,
            branch,
            template_dir,
            plugins_dir,
            static,
            install,
            version_note,
            title,
            license,
            license_url,
            source,
            source_url,
            api_key,
        ):
            # Your implementation goes here

.. _plugin_hook_render_cell:

render_cell(value, column, table, database, datasette)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lets you customize the display of values within table cells in the HTML table view.

``value`` - string, integer or None
    The value that was loaded from the database

``column`` - string
    The name of the column being rendered

``table`` - string or None
    The name of the table - or ``None`` if this is a custom SQL query

``database`` - string
    The name of the database

``datasette`` - Datasette instance
    You can use this to access plugin configuration options via ``datasette.plugin_config(your_plugin_name)``

If your hook returns ``None``, it will be ignored. Use this to indicate that your hook is not able to custom render this particular value.

If the hook returns a string, that string will be rendered in the table cell.

If you want to return HTML markup you can do so by returning a ``jinja2.Markup`` object.

Datasette will loop through all available ``render_cell`` hooks and display the value returned by the first one that does not return ``None``.

Here is an example of a custom ``render_cell()`` plugin which looks for values that are a JSON string matching the following format::

    {"href": "https://www.example.com/", "label": "Name"}

If the value matches that pattern, the plugin returns an HTML link element:

.. code-block:: python

    from datasette import hookimpl
    import jinja2
    import json


    @hookimpl
    def render_cell(value):
        # Render {"href": "...", "label": "..."} as link
        if not isinstance(value, str):
            return None
        stripped = value.strip()
        if not stripped.startswith("{") and stripped.endswith("}"):
            return None
        try:
            data = json.loads(value)
        except ValueError:
            return None
        if not isinstance(data, dict):
            return None
        if set(data.keys()) != {"href", "label"}:
            return None
        href = data["href"]
        if not (
            href.startswith("/") or href.startswith("http://")
            or href.startswith("https://")
        ):
            return None
        return jinja2.Markup('<a href="{href}">{label}</a>'.format(
            href=jinja2.escape(data["href"]),
            label=jinja2.escape(data["label"] or "") or "&nbsp;"
        ))

.. _plugin_hook_extra_body_script:

extra_body_script(template, database, table, view_name, datasette)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extra JavaScript to be added to a ``<script>`` block at the end of the ``<body>`` element on the page.

``template`` - string
    The template that is being rendered, e.g. ``database.html``

``database`` - string or None
    The name of the database, or ``None`` if the page does not correspond to a database (e.g. the root page)

``table`` - string or None
    The name of the table, or ``None`` if the page does not correct to a table

``view_name`` - string
    The name of the view being displayed. (`database`, `table`, and `row` are the most important ones.)

``datasette`` - Datasette instance
    You can use this to access plugin configuration options via ``datasette.plugin_config(your_plugin_name)``

The ``template``, ``database`` and ``table`` options can be used to return different code depending on which template is being rendered and which database or table are being processed.

The ``datasette`` instance is provided primarily so that you can consult any plugin configuration options that may have been set, using the ``datasette.plugin_config(plugin_name)`` method documented above.

The string that you return from this function will be treated as "safe" for inclusion in a ``<script>`` block directly in the page, so it is up to you to apply any necessary escaping.


.. _plugin_hook_extra_template_vars:

extra_template_vars(template, database, table, view_name, request, datasette)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extra template variables that should be made available in the rendered template context.

``template`` - string
    The template that is being rendered, e.g. ``database.html``

``database`` - string or None
    The name of the database, or ``None`` if the page does not correspond to a database (e.g. the root page)

``table`` - string or None
    The name of the table, or ``None`` if the page does not correct to a table

``view_name`` - string
    The name of the view being displayed. (`database`, `table`, and `row` are the most important ones.)

``request`` - object
    The current HTTP request object. ``request.scope`` provides access to the ASGI scope.

``datasette`` - Datasette instance
    You can use this to access plugin configuration options via ``datasette.plugin_config(your_plugin_name)``

This hook can return one of three different types:

Dictionary
    If you return a dictionary its keys and values will be merged into the template context.

Function that returns a dictionary
    If you return a function it will be executed. If it returns a dictionary those values will will be merged into the template context.

Function that returns an awaitable function that returns a dictionary
    You can also return a function which returns an awaitable function which returns a dictionary. This means you can execute additional SQL queries using ``datasette.execute()``.

Here's an example plugin that returns an authentication object from the ASGI scope:

.. code-block:: python

    @hookimpl
    def extra_template_vars(request):
        return {
            "auth": request.scope.get("auth")
        }

And here's an example which returns the current version of SQLite:

.. code-block:: python

    @hookimpl
    def extra_template_vars(datasette):
        async def inner():
            first_db = list(datasette.databases.keys())[0]
            return {
                "sqlite_version": (
                    await datasette.execute(first_db, "select sqlite_version()")
                ).rows[0][0]
            }
        return inner

.. _plugin_register_output_renderer:

register_output_renderer(datasette)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``datasette`` - Datasette instance
    You can use this to access plugin configuration options via ``datasette.plugin_config(your_plugin_name)``

Allows the plugin to register a new output renderer, to output data in a custom format. The hook function should return a dictionary, or a list of dictionaries, which contain the file extension you want to handle and a callback function:

.. code-block:: python

    @hookimpl
    def register_output_renderer(datasette):
        return {
            'extension': 'test',
            'callback': render_test
        }

This will register `render_test` to be called when paths with the extension `.test` (for example `/database.test`, `/database/table.test`, or `/database/table/row.test`) are requested. When a request is received, the callback function is called with three positional arguments:

``args`` - dictionary
    The GET parameters of the request

``data`` - dictionary
    The data to be rendered

``view_name`` - string
    The name of the view where the renderer is being called. (`database`, `table`, and `row` are the most important ones.)

The callback function can return `None`, if it is unable to render the data, or a dictionary with the following keys:

``body`` - string or bytes, optional
    The response body, default empty

``content_type`` - string, optional
    The Content-Type header, default `text/plain`

``status_code`` - integer, optional
    The HTTP status code, default 200

A simple example of an output renderer callback function:

.. code-block:: python

    def render_test(args, data, view_name):
        return {
            'body': 'Hello World'
        }

.. _plugin_register_facet_classes:

register_facet_classes()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Return a list of additional Facet subclasses to be registered.

Each Facet subclass implements a new type of facet operation. The class should look like this:

.. code-block:: python

    class SpecialFacet(Facet):
        # This key must be unique across all facet classes:
        type = "special"

        async def suggest(self):
            # Use self.sql and self.params to suggest some facets
            suggested_facets = []
            suggested_facets.append({
                "name": column, # Or other unique name
                # Construct the URL that will enable this facet:
                "toggle_url": self.ds.absolute_url(
                    self.request, path_with_added_args(
                        self.request, {"_facet": column}
                    )
                ),
            })
            return suggested_facets

        async def facet_results(self):
            # This should execute the facet operation and return results, again
            # using self.sql and self.params as the starting point
            facet_results = {}
            facets_timed_out = []
            # Do some calculations here...
            for column in columns_selected_for_facet:
                try:
                    facet_results_values = []
                    # More calculations...
                    facet_results_values.append({
                        "value": value,
                        "label": label,
                        "count": count,
                        "toggle_url": self.ds.absolute_url(self.request, toggle_path),
                        "selected": selected,
                    })
                    facet_results[column] = {
                        "name": column,
                        "results": facet_results_values,
                        "truncated": len(facet_rows_results) > facet_size,
                    }
                except QueryInterrupted:
                    facets_timed_out.append(column)

            return facet_results, facets_timed_out

See `datasette/facets.py <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/master/datasette/facets.py>`__ for examples of how these classes can work.

The plugin hook can then be used to register the new facet class like this:

.. code-block:: python

    @hookimpl
    def register_facet_classes():
        return [SpecialFacet]


.. _plugin_asgi_wrapper:

asgi_wrapper(datasette)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Return an `ASGI <https://asgi.readthedocs.io/>`__ middleware wrapper function that will be applied to the Datasette ASGI application.

This is a very powerful hook. You can use it to manipulate the entire Datasette response, or even to configure new URL routes that will be handled by your own custom code.

You can write your ASGI code directly against the low-level specification, or you can use the middleware utilites provided by an ASGI framework such as `Starlette <https://www.starlette.io/middleware/>`__.

This example plugin adds a ``x-databases`` HTTP header listing the currently attached databases:

.. code-block:: python

    from datasette import hookimpl
    from functools import wraps


    @hookimpl
    def asgi_wrapper(datasette):
        def wrap_with_databases_header(app):
            @wraps(app)
            async def add_x_databases_header(scope, recieve, send):
                async def wrapped_send(event):
                    if event["type"] == "http.response.start":
                        original_headers = event.get("headers") or []
                        event = {
                            "type": event["type"],
                            "status": event["status"],
                            "headers": original_headers + [
                                [b"x-databases",
                                ", ".join(datasette.databases.keys()).encode("utf-8")]
                            ],
                        }
                    await send(event)
                await app(scope, recieve, wrapped_send)
            return add_x_databases_header
        return wrap_with_databases_header

.. _publishing:

=================
 Publishing data
=================

Datasette includes tools for publishing and deploying your data to the internet. The ``datasette publish`` command will deploy a new Datasette instance containing your databases directly to a Heroku, Google Cloud or Zeit Now hosting account. You can also use ``datasette package`` to create a Docker image that bundles your databases together with the datasette application that is used to serve them.

.. _cli_publish:

datasette publish
=================

Once you have created a SQLite database (e.g. using `csvs-to-sqlite <https://github.com/simonw/csvs-to-sqlite/>`_) you can deploy it to a hosting account using a single command.

You will need a hosting account with `Heroku <https://www.heroku.com/>`__ or `Google Cloud <https://cloud.google.com/>`__. Once you have created your account you will need to install and configure the ``heroku`` or ``gcloud`` command-line tools.

Publishing to Heroku
--------------------

To publish your data using Heroku, first create an account there and install and configure the `Heroku CLI tool <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli>`_.

You can publish a database to Heroku using the following command::

    datasette publish heroku mydatabase.db

This will output some details about the new deployment, including a URL like this one::

    https://limitless-reef-88278.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku

You can specify a custom app name by passing ``-n my-app-name`` to the publish command. This will also allow you to overwrite an existing app.

.. literalinclude:: datasette-publish-heroku-help.txt

.. _publish_cloud_run:

Publishing to Google Cloud Run
------------------------------

`Google Cloud Run <https://cloud.google.com/run/>`__ launched as a beta in in April 2019. It allows you to publish data in a scale-to-zero environment, so your application will start running when the first request is received and will shut down again when traffic ceases. This means you only pay for time spent serving traffic.

You will first need to install and configure the Google Cloud CLI tools by following `these instructions <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/>`__.

You can then publish a database to Google Cloud Run using the following command::

    datasette publish cloudrun mydatabase.db

You may need to interact with prompts from the tool. Once it has finished it will output a URL like this one::

    Service [datasette] revision [datasette-00001] has been deployed
    and is serving traffic at https://datasette-j7hipcg4aq-uc.a.run.app

During the deployment the tool will prompt you for the name of your service. You can reuse an existing name to replace your previous deployment with your new version, or pick a new name to deploy to a new URL.

.. literalinclude:: datasette-publish-cloudrun-help.txt

Publishing to Zeit Now v1
-------------------------

Datasette can be deployed to Zeit Now's older v1 hosting platform. They no longer accept new signups for this service, so this option is currently only available if you created an account before January 2019.

To publish your database(s) to a new instance hosted by Zeit Now v1, install the `now cli tool <https://zeit.co/download>`__ and then run the following command::

    datasette publish nowv1 mydatabase.db

This will upload your database to Zeit Now, assign you a new URL and install and start a new instance of Datasette to serve your database.

The command will output a URL that looks something like this::

    https://datasette-elkksjmyfj.now.sh

You can navigate to this URL to see live logs of the deployment process. Your new Datasette instance will be available at that URL.

Once the deployment has completed, you can assign a custom URL to your instance using the ``now alias`` command::

    now alias https://datasette-elkksjmyfj.now.sh datasette-publish-demo.now.sh

You can use ``anything-you-like.now.sh``, provided no one else has already registered that alias.

You can also use custom domains, if you `first register them with Zeit Now <https://zeit.co/docs/features/aliases>`_.

.. literalinclude:: datasette-publish-nowv1-help.txt

.. _publish_custom_metadata_and_plugins:

Custom metadata and plugins
---------------------------

``datasette publish`` accepts a number of additional options which can be used to further customize your Datasette instance.

You can define your own :ref:`metadata` and deploy that with your instance like so::

    datasette publish nowv1 mydatabase.db -m metadata.json

If you just want to set the title, license or source information you can do that directly using extra options to ``datasette publish``::

    datasette publish nowv1 mydatabase.db \
        --title="Title of my database" \
        --source="Where the data originated" \
        --source_url="http://www.example.com/"

You can also specify plugins you would like to install. For example, if you want to include the `datasette-vega <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-vega>`_ visualization plugin you can use the following::

    datasette publish nowv1 mydatabase.db --install=datasette-vega

If a plugin has any :ref:`plugins_configuration_secret` you can use the ``--plugin-secret`` option to set those secrets at publish time. For example, using Heroku with `datasette-auth-github <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-github>`__ you might run the following command::

    $ datasette publish heroku my_database.db \
        --name my-heroku-app-demo \
        --install=datasette-auth-github \
        --plugin-secret datasette-auth-github client_id your_client_id \
        --plugin-secret datasette-auth-github client_secret your_client_secret

datasette package
=================

If you have docker installed (e.g. using `Docker for Mac <https://www.docker.com/docker-mac>`_) you can use the ``datasette package`` command to create a new Docker image in your local repository containing the datasette app bundled together with your selected SQLite databases::

    datasette package mydatabase.db

Here's example output for the package command::

    $ datasette package parlgov.db --extra-options="--config sql_time_limit_ms:2500"

============
 SpatiaLite
============

The `SpatiaLite module <https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index>`_ for SQLite adds features for handling geographic and spatial data. For an example of what you can do with it, see the tutorial `Building a location to time zone API with SpatiaLite, OpenStreetMap and Datasette <https://simonwillison.net/2017/Dec/12/location-time-zone-api/>`_.

To use it with Datasette, you need to install the ``mod_spatialite`` dynamic library. This can then be loaded into Datasette using the ``--load-extension`` command-line option.

Installation
============

Installing SpatiaLite on OS X
-----------------------------

The easiest way to install SpatiaLite on OS X is to use `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_.

::

    brew update
    brew install spatialite-tools

This will install the ``spatialite`` command-line tool and the ``mod_spatialite`` dynamic library.

You can now run Datasette like so::

    datasette --load-extension=/usr/local/lib/mod_spatialite.dylib

Installing SpatiaLite on Linux
------------------------------

SpatiaLite is packaged for most Linux distributions.

::

    apt install spatialite-bin libsqlite3-mod-spatialite

Depending on your distribution, you should be able to run Datasette something like this::

    datasette --load-extension=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/mod_spatialite.so

If you are unsure of the location of the module, try running ``locate mod_spatialite`` and see what comes back.

Building SpatiaLite from source
-------------------------------

The packaged versions of SpatiaLite usually provide SpatiaLite 4.3.0a. For an example of how to build the most recent unstable version, 4.4.0-RC0 (which includes the powerful `VirtualKNN module <https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=KNN>`_), take a look at the `Datasette Dockerfile <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/master/Dockerfile>`_.

Spatial indexing latitude/longitude columns
===========================================

Here's a recipe for taking a table with existing latitude and longitude columns, adding a SpatiaLite POINT geometry column to that table, populating the new column and then populating a spatial index:

.. code-block:: python

    import sqlite3
    conn = sqlite3.connect('museums.db')
    # Lead the spatialite extension:
    conn.enable_load_extension(True)
    conn.load_extension('/usr/local/lib/mod_spatialite.dylib')
    # Initialize spatial metadata for this database:
    conn.execute('select InitSpatialMetadata(1)')
    # Add a geometry column called point_geom to our museums table:
    conn.execute("SELECT AddGeometryColumn('museums', 'point_geom', 4326, 'POINT', 2);")
    # Now update that geometry column with the lat/lon points
    conn.execute('''
        UPDATE events SET
        point_geom = GeomFromText('POINT('||"longitude"||' '||"latitude"||')',4326);
    ''')
    # Now add a spatial index to that column
    conn.execute('select CreateSpatialIndex("museums", "point_geom");')
    # If you don't commit your changes will not be persisted:
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

Making use of a spatial index
=============================

SpatiaLite spatial indexes are R*Trees. They allow you to run efficient bounding box queries using a sub-select, with a similar pattern to that used for :ref:`full_text_search_custom_sql`.

In the above example, the resulting index will be called ``idx_museums_point_geom``. This takes the form of a SQLite virtual table. You can inspect its contents using the following query:

.. code-block:: sql

    select * from idx_museums_point_geom limit 10;

Here's a live example: `timezones-api.now.sh/timezones/idx_timezones_Geometry <https://timezones-api.now.sh/timezones/idx_timezones_Geometry>`_

+--------+----------------------+----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
|  pkid  |  xmin                |  xmax                |  ymin               |  ymax               |
+========+======================+======================+=====================+=====================+

+--------+----------------------+----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| 4      |  -8.66890811920166   |  11.997337341308594  |  18.9681453704834   |  37.296207427978516 |

+--------+----------------------+----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+

You can now construct efficient bounding box queries that will make use of the index like this:

.. code-block:: sql

    select * from museums where museums.rowid in (
        SELECT pkid FROM idx_museums_point_geom
        -- left-hand-edge of point > left-hand-edge of bbox (minx)
        where xmin > :bbox_minx
        -- right-hand-edge of point < right-hand-edge of bbox (maxx)
        and xmax < :bbox_maxx
        -- bottom-edge of point > bottom-edge of bbox (miny)
        and ymin > :bbox_miny
        -- top-edge of point < top-edge of bbox (maxy)
        and ymax < :bbox_maxy
    );

Spatial indexes can be created against polygon columns as well as point columns, in which case they will represent the minimum bounding rectangle of that polygon. This is useful for accelerating ``within`` queries, as seen in the Timezones API example.

Importing shapefiles into SpatiaLite
====================================

The `shapefile format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile>`_ is a common format for distributing geospatial data. You can use the ``spatialite`` command-line tool to create a new database table from a shapefile.

Try it now with the North America shapefile available from the University of North Carolina `Global River Database <http://gaia.geosci.unc.edu/rivers/>`_ project. Download the file and unzip it (this will create files called ``narivs.dbf``, ``narivs.prj``, ``narivs.shp`` and ``narivs.shx`` in the current directory), then run the following::

    $ spatialite rivers-database.db
    SpatiaLite version ..: 4.3.0a	Supported Extensions:
    ...
    spatialite> .loadshp narivs rivers CP1252 23032
    ========
    Loading shapefile at 'narivs' into SQLite table 'rivers'
    ...
    Inserted 467973 rows into 'rivers' from SHAPEFILE

This will load the data from the ``narivs`` shapefile into a new database table called ``rivers``.

Exit out of ``spatialite`` (using ``Ctrl+D``) and run Datasette against your new database like this::

    datasette rivers-database.db \
        --load-extension=/usr/local/lib/mod_spatialite.dylib

If you browse to ``http://localhost:8001/rivers-database/rivers`` you will see the new table... but the ``Geometry`` column will contain unreadable binary data (SpatiaLite uses `a custom format based on WKB <https://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/BLOB-Geometry.html>`_).

The easiest way to turn this into semi-readable data is to use the SpatiaLite ``AsGeoJSON`` function. Try the following using the SQL query interface at ``http://localhost:8001/rivers-database``:

.. code-block:: sql

    select *, AsGeoJSON(Geometry) from rivers limit 10;

This will give you back an additional column of GeoJSON. You can copy and paste GeoJSON from this column into the debugging tool at `geojson.io <https://geojson.io/>`_ to visualize it on a map.

To see a more interesting example, try ordering the records with the longest geometry first. Since there are 467,000 rows in the table you will first need to increase the SQL time limit imposed by Datasette::

    datasette rivers-database.db \
        --load-extension=/usr/local/lib/mod_spatialite.dylib \
        --config sql_time_limit_ms:10000

Now try the following query:

.. code-block:: sql

    select *, AsGeoJSON(Geometry) from rivers
    order by length(Geometry) desc limit 10;

Importing GeoJSON polygons using Shapely
========================================

Another common form of polygon data is the GeoJSON format. This can be imported into SpatiaLite directly, or by using the `Shapely <https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/>`_ Python library.

`Who's On First <https://whosonfirst.org/>`_ is an excellent source of openly licensed GeoJSON polygons. Let's import the geographical polygon for Wales. First, we can use the Who's On First Spelunker tool to find the record for Wales:

`spelunker.whosonfirst.org/id/404227475 <https://spelunker.whosonfirst.org/id/404227475/>`_

That page includes a link to the GeoJSON record, which can be accessed here:

`data.whosonfirst.org/404/227/475/404227475.geojson <https://data.whosonfirst.org/404/227/475/404227475.geojson>`_

Here's Python code to create a SQLite database, enable SpatiaLite, create a places table and then add a record for Wales:

.. code-block:: python

    import sqlite3
    conn = sqlite3.connect('places.db')
    # Enable SpatialLite extension
    conn.enable_load_extension(True)
    conn.load_extension('/usr/local/lib/mod_spatialite.dylib')
    # Create the masic countries table
    conn.execute('select InitSpatialMetadata(1)')
    conn.execute('create table places (id integer primary key, name text);')
    # Add a MULTIPOLYGON Geometry column
    conn.execute("SELECT AddGeometryColumn('places', 'geom', 4326, 'MULTIPOLYGON', 2);")
    # Add a spatial index against the new column
    conn.execute("SELECT CreateSpatialIndex('places', 'geom');")
    # Now populate the table
    from shapely.geometry.multipolygon import MultiPolygon
    from shapely.geometry import shape
    import requests
    geojson = requests.get('https://data.whosonfirst.org/404/227/475/404227475.geojson').json()
    # Convert to "Well Known Text" format
    wkt = shape(geojson['geometry']).wkt
    # Insert and commit the record
    conn.execute("INSERT INTO places (id, name, geom) VALUES(null, ?, GeomFromText(?, 4326))", (
       "Wales", wkt
    ))
    conn.commit()

Querying polygons using within()
================================

The ``within()`` SQL function can be used to check if a point is within a geometry:

.. code-block:: sql

    select
        name
    from
        places
    where
       within(GeomFromText('POINT(-3.1724366 51.4704448)'), places.geom);

The ``GeomFromText()`` function takes a string of well-known text. Note that the order used here is ``longitude`` then  ``latitude``.

To run that same ``within()`` query in a way that benefits from the spatial index, use the following:

.. code-block:: sql

    select
        name
    from
        places
    where
        within(GeomFromText('POINT(-3.1724366 51.4704448)'), places.geom)
        and rowid in (
            SELECT pkid FROM idx_places_geom
            where xmin < -3.1724366
            and xmax > -3.1724366
            and ymin < 51.4704448
            and ymax > 51.4704448
        );

Running SQL queries
===================

Datasette treats SQLite database files as read-only and immutable. This means it
is not possible to execute INSERT or UPDATE statements using Datasette, which
allows us to expose SELECT statements to the outside world without needing to
worry about SQL injection attacks.

The easiest way to execute custom SQL against Datasette is through the web UI.
The database index page includes a SQL editor that lets you run any SELECT query
you like. You can also construct queries using the filter interface on the
tables page, then click "View and edit SQL" to open that query in the custom
SQL editor.

Note that this interface is only available if the :ref:`config_allow_sql` option
has not been disabled.

Any Datasette SQL query is reflected in the URL of the page, allowing you to
bookmark them, share them with others and navigate through previous queries
using your browser back button.

You can also retrieve the results of any query as JSON by adding ``.json`` to
the base URL.

Named parameters
----------------

Datasette has special support for SQLite named parameters. Consider a SQL query
like this:

.. code-block:: sql

    select * from Street_Tree_List
    where "PermitNotes" like :notes
    and "qSpecies" = :species

If you execute this query using the custom query editor, Datasette will extract
the two named parameters and use them to construct form fields for you to
provide values.

You can also provide values for these fields by constructing a URL::

    /mydatabase?sql=select...&species=44

SQLite string escaping rules will be applied to values passed using named
parameters - they will be wrapped in quotes and their content will be correctly
escaped.

Datasette disallows custom SQL containing the string PRAGMA, as SQLite pragma
statements can be used to change database settings at runtime. If you need to
include the string "pragma" in a query you can do so safely using a named
parameter.

Views
-----

If you want to bundle some pre-written SQL queries with your Datasette-hosted
database you can do so in two ways. The first is to include SQL views in your
database - Datasette will then list those views on your database index page.

The easiest way to create views is with the SQLite command-line interface::

    $ sqlite3 sf-trees.db
    SQLite version 3.19.3 2017-06-27 16:48:08
    Enter ".help" for usage hints.
    sqlite> CREATE VIEW demo_view AS select qSpecies from Street_Tree_List;
    <CTRL+D>

.. _canned_queries:

Canned queries
--------------

As an alternative to adding views to your database, you can define canned
queries inside your ``metadata.json`` file. Here's an example::

    {
        "databases": {
           "sf-trees": {
               "queries": {
                   "just_species": {
                       "sql": "select qSpecies from Street_Tree_List"
                   }
               }
           }
        }
    }

Then run datasette like this::

    datasette sf-trees.db -m metadata.json

Each canned query will be listed on the database index page, and will also get
its own URL at::

    /database-name/canned-query-name

For the above example, that URL would be::

    /sf-trees/just_species

You can optionally include ``"title"`` and ``"description"`` keys to show a
title and description on the canned query page. As with regular table metadata
you can alternatively specify ``"description_html"`` to have your description
rendered as HTML (rather than having HTML special characters escaped).

Canned queries support named parameters, so if you include those in the SQL you
will then be able to enter them using the form fields on the canned query page
or by adding them to the URL. This means canned queries can be used to create
custom JSON APIs based on a carefully designed SQL statement.

Here's an example of a canned query with a named parameter:

.. code-block:: sql

    select neighborhood, facet_cities.name, state
    from facetable join facet_cities on facetable.city_id = facet_cities.id
    where neighborhood like '%' || :text || '%' order by neighborhood;

In the canned query JSON it looks like this::

    {
        "databases": {
           "fixtures": {
               "queries": {
                   "neighborhood_search": {
                       "sql": "select neighborhood, facet_cities.name, state\nfrom facetable join facet_cities on facetable.city_id = facet_cities.id\nwhere neighborhood like '%' || :text || '%' order by neighborhood;",
                       "title": "Search neighborhoods",
                       "description_html": "<b>Demonstrating</b> simple like search"
                   }
               }
           }
        }
    }

You can try this canned query out here:
https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/neighborhood_search?text=town

Note that we are using SQLite string concatenation here - the ``||`` operator -
to add wildcard ``%`` characters to the string provided by the user.

.. _pagination:

Pagination
----------

Datasette's default table pagination is designed to be extremely efficient. SQL
OFFSET/LIMIT pagination can have a significant performance penalty once you get
into multiple thousands of rows, as each page still requires the database to
scan through every preceding row to find the correct offset.

When paginating through tables, Datasette instead orders the rows in the table
by their primary key and performs a WHERE clause against the last seen primary
key for the previous page. For example:

.. code-block:: sql

    select rowid, * from Tree_List where rowid > 200 order by rowid limit 101

This represents page three for this particular table, with a page size of 100.

Note that we request 101 items in the limit clause rather than 100. This allows
us to detect if we are on the last page of the results: if the query returns
less than 101 rows we know we have reached the end of the pagination set.
Datasette will only return the first 100 rows - the 101st is used purely to
detect if there should be another page.

Since the where clause acts against the index on the primary key, the query is
extremely fast even for records that are a long way into the overall pagination
set.
